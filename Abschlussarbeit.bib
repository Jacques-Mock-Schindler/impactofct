Existing research is limited in its ability to provide systems based on sound instructional design models, and only a few studies validate their design with statistical support. Objective: This study investigated the effects of a game which is based on experiential learning theory under framework of the four-component instructional design model on undergraduate students' learning performance in conceptual knowledge of object-oriented programming and computational thinking skills. Method: A pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design was used to study the effects of the experiential serious games on conceptual knowledge of OOP and CT skills of 61 non-proengineering students with and without prior programming knowledge. Findings: The statistical analyses reveal that students with and without programming experience significantly improved their understanding of fundamental concepts of OOP. There were only weak correlations among students' creative problem solving, attitudes towards digital game-based learning of programming, and learning. Implications: We provide several recommendations for researchers and practitioners for designing and developing an effective serious game to teach novice programmers computer programming.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the importance of being able to understand complex computational models for everyday life. To make sense of the evolving predictive models of the COVID-19 pandemic, global citizens need to have a firm grasp of both systems thinking (ST) and computational thinking (CT). ST is the ability to understand a problem or phenomenon as a series of interconnected elements that produce emergent behaviors. CT involves decomposing a problem into quantifiable elements represented in an algorithmic form that can be interpreted or calculated by either a computer or a person. One new framework seeks to support student engagement in ST and CT by contextualizing these two types of thinking within the practice of constructing computational models. This framework explores how various aspects of ST and CT are embedded within different modeling practices, as well as how these modeling practices can help students as they construct, revise, and use computational models. This article explores how students interact with the various aspects of ST and CT as they build and refine computational models using SageModeler (a free web-based semi-quantitative system modeling application) in a chemistry unit on evaporative cooling. Through the examples presented in this article, the authors illustrate ways in which this framework can inform curriculum design and pedagogical practice.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a group of problem-solving skills that the next generations are expected to possess. The most efficient way to make them acquire these skills is to incorporate CT into K-12 education. To this end, various education programs have been designed to improve teachers' and prospective teachers' competence in CT. Such programs designing educational experiences based on teachers' and prospective teachers' preexisting opinions and self-efficacy perceptions about CT could achieve better results. Although the acquisition of CT skills has been suggested to start early on, these beliefs of early childhood teachers and prospective teachers have been underexplored. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to examine early childhood teachers' and prospective teachers' preconceptions and self-efficacy about CT. The study was conducted with 63 teachers and 78 prospective teachers in Turkey. Data were collected via an online survey in the spring of the 2020-2021 academic year. The preconceptions were assessed using a structured questionnaire, while the CT self-efficacy was measured with the Computational Thinking Scale. The findings showed similarities between teachers and prospective teachers in the preconceptions of CT. Both of them most strongly associated CT with logical thinking, problem-solving, using algorithms, coding/programming, doing mathematics, using technology in teaching, and using computers. Yet, teachers reported stronger associations between CT and logical thinking, using algorithms, and coding/programming. Furthermore, teachers' self-efficacy perceptions in CT were significantly higher. The study findings provide some needed information to design professional development programs aiming to enhance CT practices in early education settings.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students' understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n = 21) and the control (n = 26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students' CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students' CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.},

The study was conducted in a faculty of education in Turkey and carried out conducted in an elective course in the spring semester of the 2019-2020 academic year (in an online platform due to the COVID-19 Pandemic). 38 pre-service science teachers were included in the study. In this process, pre-service science teachers' conceptual development levels regarding computational thinking and their views regarding the use of ICT in schools were collected quantitatively. The development of computational problem-solving skills of pre-service science teachers was scored by a rubric developed in this study. According to the analyzes, pre-service science teachers increased knowledge of computational thinking (t = -5,969, p = 0.000), enhanced views regarding the use of ICT in schools (t = -2,436, p = 0.020), and developed computational problem-solving skills (X[superscript 2][subscript (2)] = 9.000, p = 0,011).

The first introduces Python as a data analysis language to students of the humanities. It is different because it concentrates on the principles of the computational thinking behind data analysis rather than programming details. The second example takes the students into the world of machine learning and the whole game of social and cultural research with it.

This study uses a qualitative descriptive method to describe the thinking process of prospective teachers in solving Diophantine linear equation problems. The results showed that the first subject's thought process was started by turning the problem into a mathematical symbol, looking for the Largest Common Factor (LCF) with the Euclidean algorithm, decomposition process, and evaluation. The second subject does not turn the problem into symbols and does not step back in the algorithm. The researcher found that teacher candidates who found solutions correctly in their thinking process solved mathematical problem used CT components, including reflective abstraction thinking, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and evaluation. Further research is needed to develop the CT components from the findings of this study on other materials through learning with a CT approach.},

We analysed 26 studies carried out in K-12 between 2016 and 2020 in Europe. The results indicate that 18 different tools have been used and they can be categorized into five groups: questionnaires, tests/tasks, observations, interviews and analysis of products. From the tools we analysed, more than 50 dimensions were assessed and the vast majority of those were closer to programming skills rather than CT per se. Based on these results it seems that a common operational definition of CT, a competence model that indicates which competences students should reach at which age, and a tool that allows all different facets of CT to be assessed are currently missing.},

The existence of different sub-domains related to this skill has been pointed out. Therefore, there is a need for tools that measure these different sub-domains. Because of its structure that includes different skills, computational thinking has a structure different from that of the tools used to measure academic skills. Moreover, no special programming knowledge is required for tools that measure this ability. In order to measure this skill in younger age groups, it is possible to apply the measurement tool without adult support. At this point, it is aimed to reveal the computational thinking skills of Turkish children by adapting a test developed for the 7-9 age groups into Turkish. For this purpose, an adaptation research study was performed for TechCheck-2 developed by Relkin et al. (2020). In the study, a total of 372 primary school students studying in Ankara were contacted. Item and test analyses were performed on the data obtained as a result of the application of the test. The distinctiveness and difficulty values of the items making up the test and Kuder Richardson-20 scores were calculated.

It is thought that designing teaching processes in which science and CT processes take place together makes science learning more meaningful. With this in mind, in this study, the researchers integrated unplugged CT practices into the subject of digestive system to provide an example, and analyzed the effect of this integration on learning through students' model-based explanations by comparing it with the traditional teaching. The findings reveal that in the teaching processes that were designed based on CT practices, the total scores of the students' model-based explanations were significantly higher compared to the traditional approach. When the researchers analyzed the model-based explanations under different sub-features, it was found that this difference was mostly related to sequence and explanatory process sub-features. This reinforces the idea that CT is effective on learning complex and difficult content. Students can reflect their relational and conditional thinking, and thinking in levels practices they perform via CT activities to their scientific models and science content explanations. We believe that these findings will contribute to the scholarship on CT and science integration, which is a trending topic in the literature, and will offer insights to researchers.},

A plethora of research has proposed various hands-on robotics activities built on constructivist theories, thereby facilitating the development of knowledge based on reality for scientific and non-scientific stakeholders. Robotics may become an essential focus point within technology provision, which is an essential underlying characteristic for the seminal development of computational thinking (CT). However, despite the potential benefit of CT in developing an individual's problem-solving skills, strategies for improving this ability through hands-on robotics activities largely remain underexplored. This paper highlights the constructs drawn from hands-on robotics activities in a STEM workshop designed for pre-service teacher students. The qualitative research design involved eight participants to investigate the responses of pre-service teachers to a hands-on robotics activity intended to provide STEM material. The research findings emphasise the correlations between the CT principles and STEM learning phases and underscore the roles played by educational robotics to enhance previous literature on learning experience.},

Results showed that the presented model was suitable to assess the understanding of the concepts of abstraction and algorithmic thinking, independently of the previous experience with programming languages and pupil's gender, while assessment of decomposition needs more work and improvement, some recommendations are provided.

  abstract = {As schools and districts across the United States adopt computer science standards and curriculum for K-12 computer science education, they look to integrate the foundational concepts of computational thinking (CT) into existing core subjects of elementary-age students. Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books' target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as "foundational," "on-target," or "advanced." We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.},

The sample consisted of 82 fifth graders of three public middle schools in the academic year of 2020-2021. Participants were recruited using random sampling. The study adopted an embedded mixed design. The quantitative stage employed a pretest-posttest randomized control group design, while the qualitative staged employed a case study. Quantitative data were collected using the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy Scale (CTSES), the International Informatics and Computational Thinking Activity Task Test (IICTATT), and a Computational Thinking Performance Test (CTPT) developed by the researcher. Qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured interview questionnaire. The quantitative data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis H, paired sample t-test, and ANCOVA test on the Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS). The qualitative data were analyzed inductively using MAXQDA. There was no significant difference in CTSES scores between groups. Experimental 2 had higher IICTATT and CTPT scores than Experimental-1 and control groups. The qualitative findings were grouped into seven categories.},

This is known as "Live Action Role Play" -- more commonly referred to as "LARP." Although many settings and scenarios have been used in LARP functions (e.g., medieval, Victorian, fantasy), the most common are medieval, fantasy, or a combination of both (Konzack \& Dall, 2008). From their perspectives as a Technology and Engineering Education (TEE) professor and an undergraduate TEE student, the authors have noticed this romantic view of medieval times in many of the K-12 students they work with, who just seem to like all things medieval! They set out to explore medieval ideas with a specific goal of creating an activity--which capitalized on this interest--that purposefully integrated medieval concepts with current ideas in engineering design and computational thinking. They eventually settled on "modernizing" one classic element of medieval times: the castle. The experience, shared in this article, was enjoyable and fulfilling--and the approach (connecting modern with antiquity) should be considered as a potential model for TEE teachers as they plan their lessons. This article presents a brief description of related topics, followed by findings from the authors' own implementation of this activity into a local school.},

Next, a MANCOVA was conducted to see the effectiveness of the intervention in more depth on Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement after controlling for existing knowledge factors. The results show that there is a positive effect of teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking for students in the improvement of Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement. Moreover, the results of the MANCOVA show that overall, teaching methods using Augmented Reality applications with Computational Thinking are factors in the improvement of Computational Thinking scores, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement, which means the students' existing knowledge did not affect the results of the three dependent variables. In conclusion, this study proposed that the Computational Thinking approach with Augmented Reality application can improve Computational Thinking, Visualisation Skills and Geometry Topic achievement among students.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking -- the ability to reformulate and solve problems in ways that can be undertaken by computers -- has been heralded as a foundational capability for the 21st Century. However, there are potentially different ways to conceptualise and measure computational thinking, for instance, as generalized problem solving capabilities or as applied practice during computer programming tasks, and there is little evidence to substantiate whether higher computational thinking capabilities using either of these measures result in better quality computer programs. This study examines the relationship between different forms of computational thinking and two different measures of programming quality for a group of 37 pairs of pre-service teachers. General computational thinking capabilities were measured using Bebras tests, while applied computational thinking processes were measured using a Computational Thinking Behavioural Scheme. The quality of computer programs was measured using a qualitative rubric, and programs were also assessed using the "Dr Scratch" auto-grading platform. The Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (3rd edition, TONI-3) was used to test for confounding effects. While significant correlations between both measures of computational thinking and program quality were detected, regression analysis revealed that only applied computational thinking processes significantly predicted program quality (general computational thinking capability and non-verbal intelligence were not significant predictors). The results highlight the importance of students developing applied computational thinking procedural capabilities more than generalized computational thinking capabilities in order to improve the quality of their computer programs.},

Therefore, we propose the introduction of non-programming plugged learning in mathematics to develop students' CT. The research and teaching teams collaborated to develop an instructional design for primary school students. The participants were 112 third- and fourth-grade students (aged 9-10) who took part in three rounds of experiments. In this paper, we present an iterative problem-solving process in design-based implementation research, focusing on the implementation issues that lead to the design principles in the mathematics classroom. The computational tasks, environment, tools, and practices were iteratively improved over three rounds to incorporate CT effectively into mathematics. Results from the CT questionnaire demonstrated that the new program could significantly improve students' CT abilities and compound thinking. The results of the post-test revealed that CT, including the sub-dimensions of decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving improved threefold compared to the pre-test between the three rounds, indicating that strengthened CT design enhanced CT perceptions. Similarly, the students' and teacher' interviews confirmed their positive experiences with CT. Based on empirical research, we summarize design characteristics from computational tasks, computational environment and tools, and computational practices and propose design principles. We demonstrate the potential of non-programming plugged learning for developing primary school students' CT in mathematics.},

The students had experienced popular speech recognition usage in their daily life, such as Siri and Google Assistant; therefore, this study developed instructional material for university freshmen to learn to develop their own artificial intelligence (AI) application (app) on a smart phone with PAC in MIT App Inventor. The PAC platform and the learning material cultivated students to train their own voice classification model, which is a form of supervised machine learning in the AI domain. The results showed that both groups, who had successfully trained computers to distinguish received voice commands with PAC receiving the human voice spectrogram via the cloud platform developed by MIT, made significant progress in their learning effectiveness in AI education. When the students employed the AI app on smartphones in the CT board game, the students' voice commands could be classified, and then the corresponding command could be executed through the program to control the action of the robot car on the map, regardless of whether they were competing or not. This study not only successfully provided the students with simple AI learning material, but also cultivated their creative thinking, as identified in the survey of the computational thinking self-efficacy scale. During the process of completing a mobile phone application with AI, students should know and use the function of voice classification to achieve goals and expand their cognition of AI applications. This study concluded that the AI learning material for general students rather than students in the department of computer science facilitated the students' engagement.},

  abstract = {Background/purpose: At the beginning of the 21st century, Computational Thinking (CT) and coding were typically considered part of secondary education programs, focusing on programming and algorithm development. The early childhood classroom was not expected to find students who developed coding skills. Nevertheless, as has been the case lately, CT and coding have been characterized as fundamental skills of the 21st century, not only for computer scientists but all for citizens. However, through developmentally appropriate technologies, the development of coding skills is increasingly possible, and the result may be the advancement of CT fluency or at least familiarity in young age children. Given the enormous success of smart mobile devices and accompanying mobile apps, the question is whether apps provide the children of preschool and pre-primary school age with opportunities to cultivate their basic coding and CT skills. This study is a review article that presents a brief literature review on the apps that promote themselves that can cultivate CT and coding skills of young students. Materials/methods: This paper presents a literature review of empirical studies on apps that promote themselves to support young children's learning of CT and coding skills. Results: Despite the abundance of 'self-proclaimed educational' apps for children, there is a need for developmentally appropriate apps, specifically designed for young people to promote the development of CT concepts and coding skills in young children's life. Conclusion: This study contributes to a small but growing body of literature investigating how children process and learn fundamental coding skills from touchscreen devices. The findings of this study provide evidence that young age children can facilitate early STEM learning and foundational coding skills from developmentally appropriate playful learning experiences on smart mobile devices.},

Here, we detail the development and testing of this tool across two preservice elementary science and technology courses. Participants in this study included 52 preservice teachers in the last semester of their teacher preparation program enrolled in these courses. Data were collected using the DAPT instrument and were analyzed using open coding of respondents' depictions and written descriptions of computer programming. Findings revealed that participants held somewhat stereotypical, yet distinct conceptions of CS and computer programming (i.e., separate from science and engineering) which may provide concrete entry points into fostering computational thinking skills. Implications are discussed as they relate to elementary teacher education and research.},

After two hours of total gameplay over the course of four days, both groups performed equally well, and students' CT skills were improved significantly at the near transfer level but not at the far transfer level. Students in the control condition performed significantly better on far transfer compared to the students in the treatment condition. Regression analyses indicated that the overall use of the cognitive supports was infrequent, but the amount of time spent voluntarily using cognitive supports with help on goal setting and worked examples predicted far transfer performance. How students use the cognitive supports (subverting the use of cognitive support to conscientiously learn the computational skill by using them more as game cheat sheets) might explain these findings. Design implications and directions for future research on facilitating learning transfer with in-game supports are discussed.},

The learning objective of the curriculum was to allow students to learn the application of conversational AI on a block-based programming platform. Moreover, the empirical study actually implemented the curriculum in the formal learning of a secondary school for a period of six weeks. The study evaluated the learning performance of students who were taught with the cycle of experiential learning in one class, while also evaluating the learning performance of students who were taught with the conventional instruction, which was called the cycle of doing projects. Two factors, learning approach and gender, were taken into account. The results showed that females' learning effectiveness was significantly better than that of males regardless of whether they used experiential learning or the conventional projects approach. Most of the males tended to be distracted from the conversational AI curriculum because they misbehaved during the conversational AI process. In particular, in their performance using the Voice User Interface with the conventional learning approach, the females outperformed the males significantly. The results of two-way ANCOVA revealed a significant interaction between gender and learning approach on computational thinking concepts. Females with the conventional learning approach of doing projects had the best computational thinking concepts in comparison with the other groups.},

The implementation was based on ACODESA method. The pre and post-test scores were compared through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It was concluded that ACODESA method had a statistically significant effect on students' CT performances in the problem-solving process, cognitive processes and transposition. The qualitative data were analyzed within the framework of Habermas' construct of rationality. It was seen that in the series problem, the students showed improvement in constructing factorial concept and exponential expressions with a for loop, defining events and using them as conditionals within the if-then comparison statement. In the vector problem, the students showed improvement in constructing the components of n-dimensional vectors, constructing a for loop to find the angle between these vectors, using the if-then comparison statement to check the equality of the dimensions. The students were able to act more rationally in choosing and using the CT concepts suitable for the purpose and transferring the CT process to the others, thanks to productive argumentations and the semiotic mediational role of the Maple.},

This study aimed to examine how a teacher development program changed teachers' content knowledge and collaborative engagement, which in turn influenced their students' learning achievement.

We employed multi-level modelling to study the relationships between teacher-level variables and student achievement assessed by a CT concepts test. The teachers' content knowledge and collaborative engagement were significantly enhanced through the program, which in turn had a significant impact on student achievement. Teachers' years of teaching experience, but not their gender or whether they had majored in computer science, could also affect student achievement. The results indicate that a teacher development program can play a significant role in enhancing the teachers' CT content knowledge and collaborative engagement, which can then have a positive effect on student learning.},

The present study thus investigated the effects of a robot programming intervention versus a block play program on kindergarteners' CT, sequencing ability, and self-regulation. The experiment (robot programming) versus comparison (block play) condition was randomly assigned to four kindergarten classes, which included 101 kindergarteners (M = 64.78 months, SD = 7.64). Statistical analyses revealed that the robot programming group (N = 54) had experienced greater gains over time in sequencing ability relative to those in the block play group (N = 47; F = 5.09, p {$<$} 0.05). Children in the robot programming group with lower level of self-regulation at baseline showed larger improvements in sequencing ability over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.37, p = 0.01). Also, children in the robot programming group with older age showed larger improvements in CT over time relative to the block play group (F = 2.40, p {$<$} 0.01). The study demonstrates the positive benefits of robot programming to early childhood development in terms of CT and sequencing ability, compared to a traditional curriculum activity in ECE-block play.},

The "NGSS" lays out a progression for Using Mathematical and Computational Thinking that, in elementary school, includes familiar activities such as making quantitative comparisons, creating graphs, and using computer simulations. By high school, students should advance and be able to create or revise simulations using algorithms--mathematical and computational tasks that are far less familiar to both students and teachers. The lesson presented in this article is designed to assist students and teachers to move from the familiar (simulation user) into less-explored territory (simulation creator). The lesson was implemented in a high school STEM elective course and consists of four 55-minute class sessions that help students develop greater proficiency in the two targeted SEPs. The lesson uses two open-source software tools: Concord Consortium and Insight Maker. Students first use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity (HSESS3-6) and then (2) develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the relationship between systems or components of a system (HS-LS2-5).},

The prominence of computer science education has increased in K-12 South Korean schools with the effect of the 2015 Revised National Curriculum and the National Plan for Activating Software Education. In addition, there are active efforts to include CT in science, technology, and mathematics classrooms. Therefore, this study aims to review prior studies on CT in science and mathematics education. The results of this study are as follows: (1) CT in science and mathematics education has a different conceptual approach than CT in computer education. Science education is mostly about problemsolving activities using computers, and mathematics education mostly utilizes the 'abstraction' related approach. (2) The key to improving CT in both subjects is to implement practical experience in science and mathematics education. Variables of interest in prior studies were scientific and mathematical problem-solving skills, the attitude of subjects, and creativity. (3) CT education in science and mathematics education has used a convergence education approach (STEAM education).},

Many empirical studies in this area have yet to elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from 2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized programming and student-centered instructional approaches were facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover, CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2) applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3) generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12 contexts.},

The second one, which is the main study of this paper, presents the results of an ecology-based computational design workshop. According to the results of the first study, computer-based design courses in Turkey usually lack the dimension of "computational thinking", focusing only on computer-aided design tools. Moreover, we have also found out that ecology courses in Turkish architectural education are mostly elective, and hence, have only very indirect connection to the architectural design studio. In the second study, we have demonstrated how incorporating computational thinking into the design process increase students' awareness of the ecological dimension and their ability to make this dimension an integral part of their projects. The paper concludes by elaborating on the importance of computational methods in architectural education.},

This can be very challenging for South African science teachers. Thus, there is an increasing need to prepare teachers and systematically engage them in professional development activities to help them learn, unlearn, relearn and restructure their thoughts, perceptions and attitudes towards integrating CT in science classrooms. This study explored teachers' perceptions and concerns about integrating CT in science teaching. Twenty-two science teachers from innercity secondary schools in South Africa were chosen to be part of this exploratory case study. Data were collected through take-home assignments and focus group discussions containing a series of open-ended questions. The concern-based adoption model was used as a lens to understand teachers' stages of concern. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. It was found that sampled science teachers viewed CT as a valuable tool that can help promote learners' data management practices and problem-solving practices, especially in reducing complex problems to researchable problems. The findings also showed that teachers intend to integrate CT into their science classrooms by refining their existing practices. However, teachers showed high informational, personal and management-related concerns regarding integrating CT in South African science classrooms: they needed more practical and contextual ideas on strategically integrating CT in their daily lessons. Conversely, teachers showed limited concern at the unrelated, consequence, collaboration and refocusing stage. This suggests a need for teacher education programmes in South Africa to focus more acutely on training pre-service teachers on how to plan and design science instruction using computational thinking concepts and practices.},

For this, we accomplished a study of intervention research type with students and teachers analyzing quantitative and qualitative aspects. The results indicate that the introduction of ER can favor students in the development of CT skills and learning High School subjects.},

However, a systematic review that specifically discusses game based in VR (GBiVR) settings is lacking. This paper reports previous studies systematically about the strategies used to learn CT through games and VR applications. 15 papers were selected through "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) guidelines. As the result, this study proposes a conceptual framework for designing a strategy to learn CT through GBiVR settings.

Mixed-method research was carried out to explore whether there were differences between the groups, and to learn the students' opinions and experiences regarding the practices. For the quantitative phase, a quasi-experimental design was used with two groups. For qualitative phase, 12 students were interviewed. The participants were 84 sixth-grade students (between the ages of 10 and 11). The intervention was designed on a selection/construction of activities from seven different basic programming web platforms for the plugged-in group and the proposed national curriculum unplugged activities for the unplugged group. The results showed that significant differences between groups in academic achievement favoring the unplugged activities, but not in CT skills. Development in CT skills contributed to the unplugged group's academic achievement. In addition, qualitative results showed that the plugged-in group perceived their activities as fun and entertaining, but not exactly like a lesson; in contrast, the unplugged group did not experience anxiety or boredom since they perceived the activities as educational. CT explained 27 percent of the variance in academic achievement, suggesting that this skill is important for academic achievement in basic programming. These results suggest that students can improve their academic achievement and maintain the level of CT acquisition across unplugged and plugged-in activities. This article contributes to the body of knowledge about the positive impact of unplugged activities on teaching CT and programming fundamentals.},

Rasch model of the Item Response Theory and the discrimination analysis of the Classical Testing Theory were conducted for item analyses. Pearson's correlation analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between CTT-ES and CTS scores. The results showed that the final CTT-ES including 16 items had a good fitness, discrimination, and reliability to evaluate elementary students' domain-general CT competencies. The convergent validity of CTT-ES was confirmed by its significant correlations with the CTS scores. The significant regression model not only showed students' CT competencies can be predicted by their CT dispositions but also supported The Developmental Model of CT. This study provided a valid and reliable tool for assessing young children's CT abilities. It also furthered our understanding about the developmental orders of CT abilities and contributed to the theoretical construction of CT.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.},

Globally it has been considered as vital abilities for solving genuine issues successfully and efficiently in the 21st century. Recent studies have revealed that the nurture of CT mainly centered on measuring the technical skill. There is a lack of conceptualization and instruments that cogitate on CT disposition and attitudes. This study attends to these limitations by developing an instrument to measure CT concerning dispositions and attitudes. The instruments' validity and reliability testing were performed with the participation from secondary school students in Malaysia. The internal consistency reliability, standardized residual variance, construct validity and composite reliability were examined. The result revealed that the instrument validity was confirmed after removing items. The reliability and validity of the instrument have been verified. The findings established that all constructs are useful for assessing the disposition of computer science students. The implications for psychometric assessment were evident in terms of giving empirical evidence to corroborate theory-based constructs and also validating items' quality to appropriately represent the measurement.},

Furthermore, it is uncertain if the frequency of ICT use is related to pre-service teachers' practical experience. These questions are examined based on a representative German secondary school teacher survey (N =~1218) using logistic regression analyses. Taking further variables on school level and teacher level into account, it could be shown that teachers' self-assessed technological pedagogical and content knowledge to use ICT in instruction is the most relevant predictor of the frequency of use and the fostering of students' computational thinking. Overall, there were hardly any differences between the more theoretical and the more practical phases of teacher education.},

CMA software version 3.3 was used to analyze the collected data. The result of the meta-analysis showed that both the UA and PE teaching approaches are useful in cultivating students' CT. Besides, the effect of the PE teaching approach is better than the UA teaching approach in CT education. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of moderator variables (grade level, interdisciplinary course, and experiments duration) on the relationship between UA or PE and CT education. The results showed that the effects of UA teaching approach in CT education was stronger (a) for primary school students than for secondary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with long duration teaching experiments than with medium and short duration teaching experiments. However, these effects are not significant. The effects of the PE teaching approach in CT education were stronger (a) for secondary school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with short duration teaching experiments than with long and medium duration teaching experiments. These effects are not significant either. Therefore, we suggest that (1) the UA teaching approach should be used more for primary school students, while the PE teaching approach should be used more for secondary students; (2) CT education should be integrated into other subjects through UA and PE teaching approaches; and (3) the UA teaching approach requires more teaching time than the PE teaching approach does in CT education.},

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

The most important goals of integrating CS into STEM are to develop students' computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills. STEM education creates a natural context for integrating CT into learning and teaching processes. However, applied studies are needed since the subject is new and open to development. In this study, we designed an interdisciplinary unplugged programming activity to integrate CT into STEM activities which we then implemented in a professional development course (PD) with the participation of STEM teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness, an open-ended questionnaire was given to the teachers and the results were analyzed. Accordingly, the teachers stated that the activity was exemplary in applying the interdisciplinary approach and enabling the perspectives of different disciplines to be seen by other subject-area teachers. Also, using unplugged programming activities in teacher education provides an important example. Teachers who want to conduct unplugged programming activities in their classrooms, learn how to integrate CT into STEM, are interested in the practice to support their students' research skills, and aim to support students' 21st-century skills can also use this activity. The interdisciplinary structure of the activity and its example of integrating CT into STEM will guide practitioners and researchers in the field.},

Thus, the paucity of research in this emerging area warranted a scoping review approach. This scoping review surveys existing CT studies with preschool-age participants and maps what is known of CT learning experience design, intended educational outcomes, and CT study design. Evidence from the reviewed articles (n = 17) indicate most studies used physical kits, task-oriented activities, and varying experience timeframes and adult scaffolding. Most studies focused on learning sequencing and events with few embedding remixing and reusing skills. Additionally, studies primarily implemented pre-post research design approaches, and few utilized qualitative methods. The analysis of the reviewed articles indicates gaps exist in CT experience designs, scope of CT interventions, and CT tool research and development. We conclude with recommendations for closing the knowledge gaps by providing specific future research directions.},

For studies with young adolescents as participants, manifested research philosophies are sometimes inconsistent with societal pluralisms. Objective: Based on research literature from 2016 to early 2019 for CT{\textbar}P in required science and engineering classes with youth ages 10-15 -- a sensitive age range for cognitive and affective development -- we wrote a literature review that argues for the use of more pluralistic and critical research philosophies, which will strengthen research design, implementation, and meta-inferences (Collins et al., 2012). Method: We analyzed 20 qualifying studies per research philosophies common to mixed research, giving extra attention to studies that acknowledge cultural pluralisms, engage those pluralisms in conversation with each other, and ensure that historically marginalized populations have equiTable -- not just equal -- participation (Onwuegbuzie \& Frels, 2013). Findings: We found that studies consistently emphasized "pragmatism-of-the-middle" and "communities of practice"; sometimes operated within "critical realist," "pragmatism-of-the-right," or "transformative-emancipatory philosophies"; and rarely engaged in "dialectical ways." Implications: To avoid decontextualized or overly individualistic approaches that fail to address systemic and institutional social inequities (in education, housing, healthcare, policing, voting, etc.), future work should take more pluralistic and critical philosophical approaches. We highlight several exemplars in hope that research will support youth in maintaining and extending computational practices in culturally sustaining ways (Paris, 2012).},

It is important to describe the CT field in detail and to determine the research interests and trends of studies in this field. In this most comprehensive and first topic modeling based study in the field of CT, it was aimed to determine the current situation and research interests and trends in the articles on CT from past to present. For this aim, articles containing the term "computational thinking" in the title, keywords and abstract were retrieved by a search on January 18, 2022 from Scopus database. As a result of the search, a total of 1083 articles related to CT published in the Scopus database as of the end of 2021 were obtained. The bibliometric analysis findings of the study showed that there has been a significant increase in the number of publications in this field, especially since 2015. Studies are mostly of United States origin. Although the studies are interdisciplinary, they have been published mainly in journals in the field of educational technologies. The topic modeling analysis showed that the articles in this field were grouped under 13 topics. The first three of these topics, in order of volume, are "Game based learning", "Programming skills" and "Early child coding", respectively. When the acceleration of the topics is examined, the first three, whose weight increased over time compared to other topics, came to the fore as "Programming skills", "Early child coding" and "robotic programming", respectively. As a result, it is expected that this study will guide future studies in terms of determining research interests and trends in the field of CT.},

For the study we designed tasks that included mathematic problem solving and programming. The tasks were designed based on input from three mathematics teachers who participated in individual workshops. Over a period of approximately six weeks, three families worked together on the tasks. In the process, they were told to self-record and self-assess the process. The families video-recorded the process and after each task they completed they answered a few questions. At the end of the intervention, we interviewed the families about the process. The results showed examples of how the families worked with mathematics and programming within different practices. In general, the children were more challenged when it came to understanding the problems, the abstraction process and problem solving. In this part they received guidance from the parents. Conversely, the children were not particularly challenged by programming and in applying mathematics in the solutions.},

While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists' lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses.},

A three-phase Educational Design Research study was employed to develop this framework. It involved six schools, eleven teachers, four content experts, and 446 students. Data was gathered using various means: teacher interviews and diaries, students' questionnaires, artefacts, and tests. The ADAPTTER framework is offered as a way for teachers and researchers to design a CT course, understand its components and have conversations around the same.},

This study was designed to develop students' learning achievement and computational thinking (CT) abilities by using a Design Thinking (DT)-Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) engineering design framework in a flipped web programming course. The participants were 41 students (males = 17, females = 24) coming from a Taiwan University. All of the students (20-21~years old) had e-learning-related backgrounds in a teacher's college. The experiment was conducted for 14~weeks. The flipped learning and flipped DT-CDIO course each had a total teaching time of 6~weeks, and the midterm exam and final exam each took one week. We used a questionnaire and formative assessment to examine the students' computational thinking ability and learning achievement before and after the course was applied. The results showed the students significantly improved their learning achievement and computational thinking ability. There were no significant gender differences in learning achievement. Some gender differences could be seen in some dimensions of CT ability. This study shows that the DT-CDIO framework brings many benefits to promote interdisciplinary learning by attracting STEAM talent and providing evidence to support the importance of flipped web programming courses.},

More curricula and assessments, however, are needed to cultivate and measure CT for different learning goals. Maker activities have the potential to improve student CT, but more validated assessments are needed for maker activities. We developed a set of activities for students to improve and assess essential CT skills by creating real-life applications using Arduino, a microcontroller often used in maker activities. We examined the psychometric features of CT performance assessments with rubrics and the effectiveness of the maker activities on improving CT. Two high school physics teachers implemented these Arduino activities and assessments with fifteen high school students during three days in a summer program. The participating students took an internal content-involved and an external CT~tests before and after participating in the program. The students also took the performance-based CT assessment at the end of the program. The data provide reliability and validity evidence of the Arduino assessment as a tool to measure CT. The pre- and post-test comparison indicates that students significantly improved their scores on the content-involved assessment aligned with the Arduino activities, but not on the content-free CT assessment. It shows that Arduino, or some equipment similar, can be used to improve students' CT skills~and the Arduino maker activities can be used as performance assessments to measure students' engineering involving CT skills.},

This chapter begins by articulating the intricacies of the underlying processes of SRL, principles of AfL, and computational thinking practices in CS. Using the undergraduate introductory CS course referred to above, key practices of SRL and AfL will be illustrated to demonstrate how student learning of CS programming is structured with various online and offline supports.

Item response theory analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, correlation analysis, and calculation of Cronbach's alpha were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the validity and reliability of the two measurements. The results showed that these two measurements are acceptable for assessing CT among young children, demonstrating good validity and reliability, despite limitations such as the weak factor loadings of some items and low internal consistency of subfactors. These two CT measurements were significantly and positively correlated with early mathematical ability. Thus, these two measurements are acceptable for assessing CT among young children with varying CT ability, as they present good psychometric properties of the overall scores even though they have low internal consistency of subfactors and slightly weak correlations between subfactors.},

Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner's activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed.},

The results showed that, in general, the most frequent error appeared in problems in which movements were set in a Euclidean space of two dimensions. That is to say, the problems' solving required a selection of different commands: turn, moving forward and/or backwards. Moreover, more than half of the participants who answered the open-ended question succeeded in owning the robot concept once they had solved the problems.},

To accomplish this, the research team randomly assigned thirteen schools in a northeastern state of the United States to teach the Coding as Another Language curriculum or to a "business as usual" control condition. These thirteen schools were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (CAL condition) or control group, with six schools designated to the CAL condition and seven schools designated to the control group. Participants in the study, referred to as Impact Study A, initially included 37 kindergarten, first-, and second-grade teachers, including supporting teachers, and 464 kindergarten, first- and second-grade students from 28 classrooms in the treatment group and 44 teachers including supporting teachers and 488 Kindergarten, first, and second-grade students from 36 classrooms in the control group. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to determine the impact of the CAL curriculum on first and second grade students' computational thinking, coding skills, and reading comprehension. Results showed that the CAL curriculum intervention had a significantly positive impact on students' coding performance while no notable difference was found on students' computational thinking. Additionally, an examination of students' standardized literacy achievement across the two conditions found no notable difference on students' standardized literacy achievement. This implied that even though the treatment group students allocated regular class time for the CAL curriculum, the students in the treatment group showed comparable growth on the standardized assessments with the students in the control group.},

The students' perceptions of the game were collected via questionnaires and information on their use of the tool was extracted from log files. Results indicated that "coding motivation and feeling of enjoyment" were predictors of the actual use of the game, with coding motivation the dominant factor. Focus group interviews were also conducted to further explore the students' motivation to play the game. Through comparisons of active and inactive users, the qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, indicating that students who were more intrinsically motivated tended to be more active in using the game.

To facilitate the integration of CT in students' and teachers' experience and insights on implementing CT into K-12 classrooms, particularly elementary school classrooms, need to be investigated. We interviewed 12 teachers who had participated in a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning guided by a project-based learning (PBL) approach. The teachers had facilitated a STEM+CT (computational thinking) curriculum as part of their professional development that introduced fourth- to sixth-grade students to CT in an afterschool community center's program over an eight-week period. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the interviews regarding the implementation of CT into formal elementary classrooms including teachers' perceived value of CT, the challenges for classroom implementation, and their advice on how to resolve those challenges. Half of the teachers interviewed have adapted the informal STEM+CT curriculum they had facilitated in the after-school program in their own classrooms and the other half have not. We found that, while both groups of teachers cited similar challenges, teachers who have adapted the STEM+CT curriculum valued CT more specifically as a strategy for complex problem-solving. Teachers who have adapted the STEM+CT curriculum and integrated it as part of their own curriculum were more vocal and descriptive regarding the need and justifications for more teacher professional development regarding CT integration.},

This paper describes a scoping review of learning tools for integrating CT and mathematics in current empirical studies published from 2015 to 2021. The review showed that most of the studies implemented CT-intensive Math-connected integration. Five major types of CT tools had been identified, i.e., digital tangibles, apps and games, programming languages, formative or summative assessments, and other technological tools. In many instances, the tools also provide functions of assessment of CT skills. The most assessed CT competencies were including algorithms and algorithmic thinking, abstraction, testing and debugging, loops, and sequences. Geometry and Measurement was the most assessed mathematics topic.

The program comprised 12 total hours of hacking a remote control (RC) car using Micro:bit development tool. This study investigates the effects of the developed program with a single group pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design. Nineteen students participated in the study, completing survey instruments that measure CT competency and attitudes toward CT and technology, answering an open-ended questionnaire, and voluntarily took part in semi-structured interviews. The results showed that the technological problem-solving program positively affected participants' CT-related competencies. Moreover, we observed improvement in participants' attitudes toward technology due to the integration of CT into their technology education classes. This study provides a strong case for incorporating CT into technology education. It also suggests future research direction regarding the development of students' CT competencies in various technological problem-solving contexts.},

Disentangling the influence of spatial and numerical skills on CT is important, as neither should be viewed as monolithic traits. Objective: This study aimed (1) to replicate the results of a previous study by Rom{\'a}n-Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (Computers in Human Behaviour 72), and (2) to extend this research by investigating other theoretically relevant constructs. Specifying the contribution of reasoning (i.e. numerical, figural), numerical skills (i.e. arithmetic, algebra), and spatial skills (i.e. visualization, mental rotation, short-term memory) helps to better understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying CT. Method: We investigated a sample of 132 students from Grades 7-8 (age range 12-15 years). Participants completed the Computational Thinking test, as well as a variety of psychometric assessments of reasoning, numerical, and spatial skills. To determine which cognitive skills are relevant for CT, we calculated bivariate correlations and performed a linear regression analysis. Findings: Results confirmed unique contributions of figural reasoning and visualization. Additional variance was explained by algebraic skills. Implications: We conclude that CT engages cognitive mechanisms extending beyond reasoning and spatial skills.},

Students from eight winning teams in a primary school CT competition in Hong Kong participated in the study. Focus group interviews were conducted with the students and teachers separately. Data analysis revealed that the students' problem formulation processes could be divided into three stages, namely, the "Find," "Investigate," and "Define" stages. The "Investigate" stage was an essential stage connecting the "Find" and "Define" stages. Interviews showed that support from teachers and parents was necessary for students to gain a positive experience of formulating problems in primary school context. Findings suggest that CT curriculum should be designed to allocate sufficient project time and learning space for students to develop their problem formulation ability. Problem formulation abilities are critical in the development of students' creativity in computational thinking.},

However, few studies in the literature explore collaborating with teachers from different disciplines. This study investigates the effect of the professional development (PD) program designed for integrated STEM education on teachers' pedagogical design competencies and the contribution of the PD program to teachers' integrated STEM understanding. The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48~h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM.},

This meta-analysis examined the overall effects on the cognitive, social and affective competencies of collaborative versus individual problem solving in CT through programming. We identified 33 publications involving 4717 learners, which allowed for 220 effect size comparisons.

Categorical moderator analysis revealed the moderating effects of educational level, programming environment, study duration, grouping method and group size. The competency model that was generated from the synthesized literature on collaborative computational problem solving yielded insights into the learning design and assessment of relevant activities.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has the potential to enhance learning when integrated into mathematical classroom activities. Teachers are being asked to include CT concepts in their core disciplines; however, there is an open question as to how best to equip teachers to integrate CT into their practice. Oftentimes teacher candidates enter math and science methods courses with emerging ideas of what CT might be but little formal experience with the construct (Yadav et al., 2014). Relatively little is understood about the most effective ways to support candidates' understanding of CT, and how to support them in integrating CT into disciplinary instruction. In this paper, we describe a novel method of introducing teacher candidates to CT through a five-lesson module within the context of an existing pre-service teacher math and science methods course. We use an Experience First, Formalize Later format inspired by Stats Medic (2018) to help develop teacher candidates' intuitions around CT primarily through firsthand experience and the roles it can play in their math and science classrooms. This paper presents the instructional materials for this innovative approach for integrating CT into a pre-service mathematics and science methods course. We will also present data from teaching these materials with a cohort of 14 teacher candidates. Collectively, this work contributes a novel strategy for integrating CT into pre-service methods courses and contributes to our understanding of the relationship between CT and the existing disciplines of K-12 math and science, especially as seen by teacher candidates entering the profession.},

To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers' perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of "what is CT?" and "how is it evidenced?".},

The empirical study has successfully produced a new checklist that can be used as a tool to describe the learning of CT skills when children co-create digital games. The checklist consists of 10 core CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, generalisation, representation, socialisation, code literacy, automation, coordination, and debugging. Thirty-six 10-12 year-olds from sub-urban primary schools in Borneo participated in creating games in three separate eight-hour sessions. In addition, one pilot session with five participants was conducted. The game co-creation process was recorded to identify and determine how these young, inexperienced, untrained young learners collaborated while using CT skills. Analysis of their narratives while co-creating digital games revealed a pattern of using CT while developing the games. Although none of the groups demonstrated the use of all ten CTs, conclusively, all ten components of the CT were visibly present in their co-created digital games.},

In the process of teaching and learning CT, learning strategies and tools play an important role. Efforts have been made to apply several learning strategies for teaching Computational Thinking. Among them, game-based learning and scaffolding are widely adopted. However, more research is needed on how the absence and presence of scaffolding strategies in programming games could affect students' cognitive CT learning gains. This study aims to investigate the effect of scaffolding programming games on the development of middle school students' CT. In addition, herein we aim to explore the effect of students' programming attitudes in their CT development. To this end, students were introduced to CT under two distinct experimental conditions: a scaffolding version of a programming game and a non-scaffolding version of the same game. Results report statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-intervention CT scores for all students and statistically significant improvement in learning outcomes in favor of the scaffolding group. In addition, the study hypothesized that attitudes towards programming would have an impact on students' CT. Although this hypothesis has not been confirmed, the results suggest that students who have a less positive attitude towards programming could particularly benefit from scaffolding aspects in programming games.},

However, conducting hands-on coding activities in a classroom has caused substantial challenges including mixed-ability students in the same class, high student-teacher ratio and learning-hour limitation. This research proposes and develops ScratchThAI as a conversation-based learning support framework for computational thinking development to support both students and teachers. More specifically, it provides learning experiences tailored to individual needs. Students can learn CT concepts and practice online coding anywhere, anytime. Moreover, through its ScratChatbot, students can ask for CT concept explanations, coding syntax or practice exercises. Additional exercises may be assigned to students based on the diagnosed individual learning difficulties in a particular topic to provide possible and timely intervention. Teachers can track learning progress and performance of the whole class as well as of individuals through the dashboard and can take suitable intervention within limited school hours. Deploying ScratchThAI to several Thai schools has enabled this research to investigate its effectiveness in a school setting. The obtained results indicated positive teacher satisfaction, better learning performance and higher student engagement. Thus, ScratchThAI contributes as a possible and practical solution to CT skill development and CT education improvement under the aforementioned challenges in Thailand.},

The purpose of this phenomenographic study was to understand teachers' perceptions of the function and usefulness of a task analysis and a decision tree tool designed to help them with integration. Teachers participated in a long-term professional development to improve their knowledge and application of CT and then developed lesson plans integrating CT into science investigations. To assist in the integration, teachers used the two unique tools. No one lesson plan or content area addressed all of the CT practices, but all CT practices were addressed in lessons across all four science areas. All 19 teachers found that the task analysis tool helped them to shift their lessons to a student-centered focus and helped them pinpoint data practices so they could systematically integrate CT practices. However, they expressed confusion over the amount of detail to document on the tool. Similarly, teachers found both benefits and barriers to the decision tree tool. Teachers found the decision tree tool to be useful in predicting the ways students may misunderstand a data practice and in reflecting on the level of accomplishment of students. However, teachers were sometimes uncertain with how to efficiently document complex student behaviors when engaged with data practices and CT. Implications for the use of the two lesson planning tools is discussed.},

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students' knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students' final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

At a four-week robotics summer camp in China, mixed-methods research was conducted. Forty primary school students and one dedicated robotics teacher participated in this research, while 32 students and the teacher completed all the lessons and data collection procedures of the summer camp. Results indicated that students' CT skill increased during the summer camp and that the change in their CT skill was positively correlated to the time spent on S-R interaction. Additionally, how three kinds of S-R interaction-programming-computing, observational investigation, and participatory investigation-cultivated students' CT were found. Moreover, the hierarchy of three S-R interactions and students' role-shifting in the hierarchy were discussed. Previous studies rarely discussed S-R interaction; however, this kind of interaction should be explored because it provides more information about students' natural learning process, which might be meaningful to RE practice.},

However, there is still no systematic investigation of these characteristics. This study aims to provide insights on the characteristics of visual programming environments for K-9 education based on a systematic literature review of 83 empirical studies on K-9 teaching and learning programming. These characteristics are analysed based on the following four levels: a) functional features; b) student experience; c) teacher experience; d) disadvantages. Finally, herein we discuss the features that a programming environment for K-9 education could have to improve the experience of students and teachers.},

This study proposes a theoretical framework that uses modeling as a way to integrate ST and CT. We developed a framework to guide the complex process of developing curriculum, learning tools, support strategies, and assessments for engaging learners in ST and CT in the context of modeling. The framework includes essential aspects of ST and CT based on selected literature, and illustrates how each modeling practice draws upon aspects of both ST and CT to support explaining phenomena and solving problems. We use computational models to show how these ST and CT aspects are manifested in modeling.},

The subjects in this study consist of 24 students in the control group and 38 students in the experimental group from a senior high school in Indonesia. The instrument used in this study is six items of computational thinking test. This module had four themes; Genetics Disease, Cancer, Forensic Science, and Evolution, conducted in 8 sessions. Each session lasted 90 minutes. The Bioinformatics Module consists of programming and databases, including unplugged computational activities and unplugged activities including coding using Python, searching in Uniprot, and using BLAST in NCBI. The CIbT has five steps: orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion. The Mann-Whitney test results showed that the p-value from N-Gain data is {$<$} 0.01. So, Bioinformatics Module on molecular genetics concepts using CIbT can improve computational thinking skills of senior high school students.

After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs.

Particularly, it explored how unplugged tasks involve imaginative pedagogies, computational thinking skills, new media literacy skills, and social-emotional skills across three different primary schools by fulfilling two learning conditions, without coding/programming and without using digital devices. Within-case and cross-case analyses were conducted by following the qualitative multiple-case study research design. The evidence stems from lesson analysis, observation field notes, and interview transcripts with 152 participants. We collected 94 lessons from the three schools and we analyzed the data by using a predefined coding scheme grounded upon four frameworks. We conclude that the detected teaching practices uncover promising trajectories by demonstrating a great potential to consider the proposed framework as an effective and age-appropriate pedagogical approach applicable to low-technology and coding-free learning environments. The study highlights the need of teacher professional development, especially on computational thinking in reference to cognitive/intellectual, emotional/affective, social, creative/imaginative, and material dimensions for conscious computational thinking practice implementation. Given the paucity of research on unplugged and, especially, non-programming/coding methods at primary education level, this study can open up prominent issues for further examination and validation.},

  abstract = {Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and engineers. However, K-12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in K-12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the "Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations" (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions.},

However, identity research in the context of programming education to cultivate students' computational thinking is scarce. In this study, an instrument of computational identity with components of engagement, imagination and affiliation, was developed and validated. Convenience sampling was used to select 1066 senior primary school students studying programming to respond to the instrument, and to a programming empowerment instrument developed previously with components of meaningfulness, self-efficacy and impact. The two instruments' factor structure was confirmed to have acceptable discriminant validity and support gender invariance. There was a positive relationship between programming empowerment and computational identity. Specifically, students' perceived meaningfulness and self-efficacy of programming related to all aspects of computational identity. The perceived impact of programming is related only to the imaginative aspect of computational identity. The establishment of the instrument enables researchers to investigate further factors related to students' computational identity development. The results also indicate that the programming curriculum should be carefully designed so that students can realise the meaning of the activities and foster their programming self-efficacy. This, in turn, is critical to enable these primary school students to participate in and become a member of the digital community.},

Objective: This study draws on lessons learned in two fourth-grade classrooms -- one an inclusive general education classroom including students with and without disabilities, the other an inclusive GATE classroom including students with and without giftedness -- to illustrate how CT frameworks can inform inclusive CS instruction. Method: A comparative case study design integrating content analysis and first and second cycle coding of data was used to analyze teachers' instructional strategies using a CT framework. Data included transcriptions of audio-recorded classroom lessons, field notes, and conversations with teachers and students. Findings: While each teacher used different strategies, both were effective in developing students' CT. Explicit instruction provided students receiving special education services with needed structure for the complex tasks inherent to computing. Peer feedback facilitated independent computational practice opportunities for students receiving GATE. Implications: This study highlights how inclusive instructional practices can be assessed using a CT framework and leveraged to maximize learning and access to CT curricula for learners with exceptionalities.},

Interviews were held with students and teachers seven months after the applications to determine the conceptual knowledge levels of students for computational thinking skills. Teachers' opinions regarding students' feedback and the changes they observed in the students involved in the application process during the seven months were taken. Besides using one of the mixed-method research designs in this study, that is the triangulation (parallel-convergent) design, quantitative and qualitative data collection tools were used simultaneously. Through the joint use of different methods and data collection tools, obtaining rich and various types of data sets was aimed. As for the quantitative dimension of the study, 54 students, which were divided into experimental and control groups, formed the study group. In the qualitative aspect of the study, there are 20 students and three teachers. The computational thinking self-efficacy perception scale was used as a quantitative data collection tool, and the interview forms were used as qualitative data collection tools. While the analysis of quantitative data was made with Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann-Whitney U tests, the analysis of qualitative data was made with content analysis and descriptive analysis methods. As a result, a significant difference was found in the experimental group students' algorithm subdimension scores. According to the interviews held seven months after the applications, students' conceptual knowledge was at a good level. Furthermore, teachers included in the application stated that they observed positive changes in the students after the application. In line with the results obtained, suggestions were made to make arrangements for other sub-dimensions of computational thinking skills and to examine the effects of the Harezmi education model as of different variables.},

Participants in this study, referred to as Impact Study B, initially included 13 teachers and 247 students from 17 classrooms in the treatment group, and 10 teachers and 103 students from 12 classrooms in the control group. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess the impact of the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum on these second grade students' computational thinking, coding skills, and reading comprehension. Results showed that the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum intervention had a significantly positive impact on students' coding performance while no notable difference was found on students' computational thinking as both groups showed significantly higher increases of computational thinking from the baseline. Additionally, an examination of students' standardized literacy achievement across the two conditions found no notable difference findings, suggesting that even though the treatment group students allocated regular class time for the CAL-ScratchJr curriculum, the students in the treatment group showed comparable growth with the students in the control group on standardized literacy achievement assessments.

However, current evidence of the effectiveness of unplugged activities in promoting students' CT skills has been inconsistent. To understand the potential of unplugged activities on computational thinking skills, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Our review of 49 studies examined the influence of unplugged activities to improve students' CT skills in K-12 education between 2006 and 2022. The literature review showed that studies on CT skills were mainly (81.64\%) conducted in computer science and STEM education, with board and card games being the most common unplugged activities for fostering CT skills in K-12 education. CT diagnostic tools (36.37\%) were frequently used as assessment tools. A follow-up meta-analysis of 13 studies with 16 effect sizes showed a generally large overall effect size (Hedges's g = 1.028, 95\% CI [0.641, 1.415], p {$<$} 0.001) for the use of unplugged activities in promoting students' CT skills. The analysis of several moderator variables (i.e., grade level, class size, intervention duration, and learning tools) and their possible effects on CT skills indicated that unplugged activities are a promising instructional strategy for enhancing students' CT skills. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of unplugged pedagogy for promoting CT skills in K-12 education. Recommendations for policies, practice, and research are provided accordingly.},

Computational thinking is a problem-solving skill set that is used to tackle problems in computer science. However, these skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, and algorithmic thinking, are useful in other domains, as well. This study focuses on the use of CT skills to approach complex linguistic learning tasks in the foreign language classroom. To foster these problem-solving skills, an innovative method is used. The authors take advantage of computer science (CS) models (e.g. Unified Modeling Language -- UML) and transform them into a teaching and learning tool. This paper describes the design and implementation of a survey used to detect students' use of learning strategies that are linked to computational thinking. This survey is an instrument used in a multiple-case study and was administered at the beginning of the interventions. The participants of the study were learners of English and Spanish (n=66) from two secondary schools. Results indicated that the students were medium to low users of learning strategies that demand problem-solving skills related to computational thinking. Differences by gender were also found, with females reporting higher use of learning strategies than males. To conclude, the study showed a low use of strategies among students and highlighted the importance of introducing students to learning strategies and fostering skills needed for future professional life.},

  abstract = {Integrating computational thinking (CT) into various disciplines via computer science (CS) methods such as unplugged, block-based, text-based, and physical programming is a trending topic in educational sciences. This study presents a perspective on implementing an unplugged computer science activity to integrate CT into mathematics education. This study aims to examine the integration of CT into mathematics education, its classroom practice, and the opinions of students and pre-service teachers towards the unplugged CS activity. For this purpose, we developed an unplugged CS activity, which includes CT components, computer science and mathematics education achievements. The unplugged CS activity is a problem of transmitting data most efficiently and accurately between transmitter and receiver. The researchers trained twelve pre-service mathematics teachers to implement this activity in realclassroom environments. The pre-service teachers implemented the unplugged CS activity with 80 students in four classes. CT components were considered in the activity design. The students performed data collection, data analysis, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithm design, and testing and debugging, which are components of CT, during the activity. Middle school students stated that they had enjoyed the activity and that this activity made the mathematics learning process satisfying. They established a relationship between the activity and mathematics education, besides, they needed help connecting it with CS concepts. Pre-service teachers stated that they had challenges in classroom management during the activity. Classroom management should be a part of teacher education in designing and implementing CT-integrated lessons. Courses containing classroom management, CS activity design and implementation should be developed for pre-service teachers based on theory and practice within their discipline.},

  abstract = {There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students' CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students' CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants' (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using "a priori" codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students' CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has acquired the status of a necessary 21st-century skill and is currently being introduced in school curricula around the world, despite a lack of consensus about what it entails. The aims of this review are to provide an overview of the existing literature on CT activities in primary mathematics education, and to articulate how it is integrated into the teaching and learning of primary mathematics. This systematic review presents and analyses the findings of 10 empirical studies, revealing a recent increased focus on the inclusion of CT in primary mathematics classrooms, as most studies are published around 2020. Our findings indicate two categories of such activities, one focusing on skills (such as mainly sequencing, looping, conditionals, debugging, decomposition, and abstraction) and one on process-oriented activities (communication, creativity, exploration, and engagement). Furthermore, we found that, while there are studies reporting on mathematics being taught directly through CT activities (full integration), in most studies, the mathematics content was emphasised, with CT built in as a way for students to demonstrate their understanding of mathematics concepts (partial integration). This review identifies current gaps in the field and the need to investigate further such process-oriented activities, the use of these activities in accelerated mathematics, and the need for different methodological approaches in primary mathematics.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students' CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students' understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.},

However, most empirical studies have targeted CT in K-12, thus, little attention has been paid to CT in higher education. The present scoping review identifies and summarizes existing empirical studies on CT assessments in post-secondary education, aiming to reveal the current trends of empirical research in this domain and key features of recent CT assessment instruments. It examines 33 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2013 and 2019 from six databases. Results show that most assessment tools are designed for computing science and engineering undergraduates or pre-service and in-service teachers in these subjects. Most tools involve in-class interventions to promote CT skills. Several assessment formats were adopted in the selected studies, including selected-response questions, constructed-response questions, Likert scales, interviews, programming artefacts, observations, and interviews. Finally, most assessment instruments attempt to measure skills from a combination of dimensions including CT Concepts, Practices, and Perspectives from a hybrid-competency framework. More specifically, the skills assessed in most studies are algorithmic thinking, problem solving, data, logic and logical thinking, and abstraction. Findings may help instructors to select CT assessments for higher education and researchers to focus on less explored research areas.},

As the world becomes more uncertain and volatile due to impacts of artificial intelligence (AI), international unrest, climate change, global economic instability and unforeseen catastrophes such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to review, revise and refine school education curricula and policies. The issue of what is essential for students to learn, and how they learn it, is of growing importance to international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and is emerging as a significant driver for educational reform across the globe. The growing prominence of CT and DL skills across many industry sectors has prompted recent changes to international assessment frameworks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper will briefly discuss specific examples of alternative approaches to addressing CT in national curricula for the compulsory years of schooling and explain how CT has been adopted as a driver for mathematics curriculum change in Australia.},

However, when the target of CT is decoupled from programming, emerging evidence challenges the assertion of CT transferability from programming. In this study, CT was operationalized in everyday problem-solving contexts in a learning experiment (n = 59) that investigated whether learning programming enhances students' CT skills. Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes -- discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students' age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis. Implications of the inconclusive finding about the transfer of programming skills to CT are emphasized and the arguments for disentangling CT from programming are highlighted.},

Both groups were tested on computational thinking ability, children's concrete operation status, degree of ego-centricity, and in-classroom interaction. Results indicated that the children aged 6-8~years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children's computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry.},

However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

The training phase of the implementation process was planned and implemented by subject experts in 4 weeks and 2 hours a week. In the research, both quantitative and qualitative research methods and exploratory sequential design were used as mixed methods. In this study, quantitative research method and pretest- post-test control group semi-experimental pattern model was used as the research model. The universe of the study consists of 5th grade students studying at a secondary school in Aksaray province Eskil district of T{\"u}rkiye in the 2019-2020 academic year. Within the scope of the research, the research participant group was determined considering that 5th grade students will receive coding training for the first time. In addition to the total number of students to be reached is 38, including 19 control and 19 experimental groups. While the "blocky" application used in block-based coding education was determined as the independent variable in the research, the students' computational thinking skills and their attitudes towards learning to code were determined as dependent variables. As a result of the applications and analysis, the difference between the values of students' computational thinking skills self-efficacy and attitudes towards learning coding before and after education is statistically significant. In order to determine the effect size of the Blocky block-based coding environment on the Information Computational Thinking Skills Self-Efficacy Scale (CTSES) and the Attitudes Toward Learning Coding Scale (ATLCS), the eta squared value was examined. It can be said that the Blocky block-based coding environment has a "large" effect size on computational thinking skills, self-efficacy perception and on the attitude towards learning coding.},

Objective: There is, however, a dearth of research coming from Africa showing the extent of CT's integration in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum. The main objective of this study was to assess the extent to which CT was integrated into Ethiopia's secondary school (Grades 9-12) information and communication technology (ICT) curriculum. Method: The Ethiopian secondary school (ESS) ICT curriculum, as portrayed in the syllabi, textbooks, and teaching guides, served as the data source for the study. The data were then subjected to qualitative thematic analysis in the Atlas.ti environment. Findings: Despite the emphasis on ICT literacy, the analysis revealed that CT was incorporated into the curriculum through the use of Logo, Excel, and multimedia projects. The integration could not however be described as "systematic". Implications: The research could provide practitioners and policymakers with evidence to chart a path for the planned integration of CT into the ESS ICT curriculum. Similar studies from K-12 to higher education levels could also benefit from the research.},

We conducted a semi-systematic literature review on 55 empirical studies on this topic. Our findings include: (a) the majority of the studies adopted domain-general definitions of CT and a few proposed domain-specific CT definitions in STEM education; (b) the most popular instructional model was problem-based instruction, and the most popular topic contexts included game design, robotics, and computational modelling; (c) while the assessments of student learning in "integrated" CT and STEM education targeted different objectives with different formats, about a third of them assessed integrated CT and STEM; (d) about a quarter of the studies reported differential learning processes and outcomes between groups, but very few of them investigated how pedagogical design could improve equity. Based on the findings, suggestions for future research and practice in this field are discussed in terms of operationalizing and assessing CT in STEM contexts, instructional strategies for integrating CT in STEM, and research for broadening participation in integrated CT and STEM education.},

  abstract = {Contemporary science education frameworks identify computational thinking as an essential science and engineering practice that supports scientific sense-making and engineering design. Despite national emphasis on teaching science, engineering, and computational thinking (NGSS Lead States, 2013), little research has investigated the ways that elementary teachers support students to engage in science and engineering practices (SEPs) within integrated science, engineering, and computational thinking curricula. This study explores how teachers provide verbal support of SEPs to upper elementary students during a 4-week NGSS-aligned curricular unit that challenged students to redesign their school to reduce water runoff. Students conducted hands-on investigations of water runoff and created computational models to test their designs. Teacher audio data during the classroom implementation was collected and qualitatively coded for different purposes of verbal support, such as to understand how (pragmatic), when, and why (epistemic) to use SEPs, in three focal lessons. Results show that teachers provided a range of pragmatic and epistemic supports for many different SEPs in science-focused and engineering-focused lessons, but support for a more limited variety of SEPs in the lesson focused on computational thinking. Across the lessons, the majority of teacher support aimed to help students engage pragmatically with the SEPs through sense making and engaging prior knowledge. In addition, teachers provided epistemic support more frequently in the science-focused lesson than in the engineering- or computational thinking-focused lessons. Results also demonstrate differences within the quality of the verbal support across lessons. This study provides insight into how teachers may differentially support SEPs in elementary classrooms and the kinds of learning experiences and educative materials teachers may need to provide equitable supports for students across SEPs.},

As the CS for All movement grows, it is essential to design integrated, justice-oriented curricula that help young multilingual learners begin to develop computational thinking skills and discourses. Purpose: We present a conceptual framework and accompanying design principles for justice-centered computational thinking activities that are language-rich, with the aim of supporting learners' agency and building their capacity over time to use computing for good in their communities. Setting: Our work takes place in a research-practice partnership centered in an elementary school in California with a significant multilingual Latinx population. Research Design: We have engaged in two cycles of design-based research with preservice and in-service teachers at an elementary school. Through analysis of one case study during the second and most recent cycle, we examined the potential of teachers using our design principles for supporting multilingual learners' language development through engagement in computational thinking. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that multilingual learners will engage in productive discourse when computational thinking lessons are designed to (1) be meaningfully contextualized, (2) position students as agentic learners, and (3) promote coherence over time. However, more research is needed to understand how teachers use these principles over time, and what additional supports are needed to ensure coordination between stakeholders to develop and effectively implement coherent learning progressions.},

However, there is a lack of focus on CT and CS access for children with disabilities. This study investigates the effect of the robot development process at the secondary school level on the algorithmic thinking and mental rotation skills of students with learning disabilities (LD). The study was conducted with the single-subject model and as an A-B-A design. In the study, the CT skill development of four students with LD (1 female, 3 male) was monitored throughout 13 weeks with the pre-treatment sessions running from weeks 1-4, treatment sessions running from weeks 5-9, and post-treatment sessions running from weeks 10-13. During the treatment sessions, robot design and programming implementations were performed. During these 13 sessions, the observer scored participants' both algorithmic problem-solving and mental rotation skills. These skills are also required to use some other cognitive sub-skills (i.e., selective attention, processing speed) which were defined by ten special education experts at the beginning of the study. All these skills were evaluated according to how well the students performed the following four criteria: (1) To start to perform the instructions quickly (processing speed), (2) to focus on the task by filtering out distractions (selective attention), (3) to fulfill the task without having to have the instructions repeated, (4) to perform algorithmic problem-solving/mental rotation tasks without any help. Considering the results on the participants' algorithmic problem-solving skills, a significant improvement was obtained in their skills after the treatment process. The improvement obtained in the participants' mental rotation skills is another important result of the study. Considering the study results from a holistic perspective, it can be concluded that the robot development implementation, as educational technology, can be used to support the cognitive development of students with learning disabilities.},

Ninety-four middle school students from China aged between 16 and 18 participated in this study. Forty-six students were in the experimental group, and 48 students were in the control group. Students in the experimental group learned under the socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) condition, which included planning and goal setting, task and content monitoring, and task and content evaluation. Students in the control group learned in a traditional way. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed their counterparts on the midtest and posttest. Additionally, the learning gain of the experimental group was much better from the pretest to the midtest. Different subgroups in the experimental group had different learning performances, and task monitoring and content monitoring were two important SSRL processes that led to improved computational thinking performance. Our results suggest that SSRL is beneficial for learning computational thinking subjects. Throughout the process of SSRL, different groups have different learning dynamics, and task and content monitoring plays a major role in computational thinking performance.},

We evaluated the papers under the headings of development approaches, learning tools, sub-skills, research groups, measurement tools, and prominent findings. According to the results, while for programming, robotics, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), development courses and computer science unplugged approaches were adopted in the development of CT, CT was mostly associated with the field of computer science. Programming and robotics software such as Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, M-Bot, Arduino and Bee-Bot are tools with a block-based coding interface. While there was no consensus on the scope and measurement of CT, CT was generally studied within the framework of abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging subskills. CT developments were measured through scales and tests consisting mostly of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. The research focused on primary and secondary school students while it was limited on preschool level. In addition, studies stating that gender is an effective factor in the development of CT in different age groups are in the majority. Whilst trying to integrate CT into courses in schools, the number of development courses for pre-service and in-service teachers is increasing. Within the framework of the results obtained from the research, the differences in the scope, development, measurement, and evaluation of CT are discussed.},

This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs.},

However, there are few empirical examples for how intertwining three dimensions facilitates learning. In this study, we used a learning progressions approach to examine how student engagement in computational thinking (science and engineering practice) intertwines with learning about the flow of water through environmental systems (disciplinary core ideas) and understanding of systems and system models (crosscutting concept). We developed three secondary-level curriculum units situated in current groundwater contamination and urban flooding contexts. Units included specially designed NetLogo computational models. Post-assessments measured student performances in computational thinking processes and understanding of hydrologic systems. Using item response theory in our analysis, we identified distinct levels of performance on a learning progression. At the lower end, literal model users interacted with models and manipulated model interfaces to achieve a specified goal. In the middle, Model Technicians used computational models to solve real-world problems. At the upper end, principle-based model users used computational thinking processes and principles related to systems modeling and hydrology to explain how the models worked to predict water flow. Differences between performances of literal model users, model technicians, and principle-based model users reflected shifts in how students made sense of the systems and system models crosscutting concept. These shifts in performances aligned with progress in computational thinking practices and finally with use of hydrology disciplinary core ideas. These findings contribute to understanding of how science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts intertwine during learning; how computational thinking practices develop; and how computational thinking about system models facilitates learning for environmental science literacy.},

We argue that a well-structured and sound competence model is needed as a shared foundation for learning, teaching, pedagogical diagnostics and evaluative schemes in the school system. Every competence model should build upon a consistent, theoretically sound framework for teaching and learning. We consequently develop a competence model for digital competence by drawing on the concept of computational thinking as well as on general learning taxonomies. By combining different knowledge and process dimensions with essential facets of computational thinking a cube model of digital competence can be constructed. Hence, we develop and substantiate a structure model for digital competence building upon the concept of computational thinking that goes beyond the existing frameworks only focusing on the subject-related context and present this for discussion. The next step would then be to supplement the structure model with specific learning objectives, so that developing approaches to teaching and learning digital competence has a sound basis.

  abstract = {Scholars believe that computational thinking is one of the essential competencies of the 21st century and computer programming courses have been recognized as a potential means of fostering students' computational thinking. In tradition instruction, PFCT (problem identification, flow definition, coding, and testing) is a commonly adopted procedure to guide students to learn and practice computer programming. However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students' computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students' learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students' computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores.},

Each cohort participated in a six-hour intervention, as part of a four-day summer club. During the intervention children were introduced to ScratchJr and were asked to collaboratively design a digital story about environmental waste management actions, thus adopting a disciplinary perspective to computational thinking. Data analyses examined children's final artifacts, in terms of coding practices and the level of computational thinking demonstrated by each cohort. Furthermore, analysis of selected groups' storyboard interviews was used to shed light on differences between the two cohorts. Results are presented and contrasted across the two age cohorts via a developmental perspective. The findings of this study can be useful in considering the instructional support that is necessary to scaffold the development of primary school children's coding practices and computational thinking.},

Teacher engagement with young learners is important in supporting learning, understanding what learners know, and also in potentially advancing a learner's understanding. The relative newness of CT for many teachers suggests that teachers may not recognize CT during play. We used several frameworks to examine CT. Video clips and images of children in the classroom setting were examined by the researchers and teachers to identify instances of CT. Evidence of CT was found in children's free play.

This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students' STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95\% CI of 0.57-1.14]; p {$<$} 0.001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.},

Currently, there is a lack of such assessments in upper primary school. That is why we present the development and validation of the competent CT test (cCTt), an unplugged CT test targeting 7-9~year-old students. In the first phase, 37 experts evaluated the validity of the cCTt through a survey and focus group. In the second phase, the test was administered to 1519 students. We employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to assess the instruments' psychometric properties. The expert evaluation indicates that the cCTt shows good face, construct, and content validity. Furthermore, the psychometric analysis of the student data demonstrates adequate reliability, difficulty, and discriminability for the target age groups. Finally, shortened variants of the test are established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. To conclude, the proposed cCTt is a valid and reliable instrument, for use by researchers and educators alike, which expands the portfolio of validated CT assessments across compulsory education. Future assessments looking at capturing CT in a more exhaustive manner might consider combining the cCTt with other forms of assessments.},

Through analysis of classroom-based data, including samples of student work, we were able to develop an understanding of the manner with which student understanding of computational thinking emerged in this classroom. Findings suggest that, through the integration of carefully designed learner-centered tasks, students came to view computational thinking as computer mediated data analysis or an approach to analyzing data and solving problems. The iterative nature of the instructional design--three consecutive units built around the same heuristic of data-patterns-rules--as well as the variety of learning-centered tasks given to students, appeared to have enabled the teacher and students to have a common set of procedures for problem solving and a common language to articulate the goals and outcomes of data analysis and interpretation. Our study demonstrated that framing a lesson through the lens of computational thinking provides teachers with strategies for engaging students in a structured, yet authentic approach to grappling with complex problems relevant to the subject.},

Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error; and (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes.},

  abstract = {Computers and computer algorithms have contributed to important scientific advances by allowing scientists and engineers to create and use sophisticated models to explain and predict phenomena. Yet, of the eight "Next Generation Science Standards" ("NGSS") science and engineering practices, computational thinking may be the least familiar to teachers and students. In the "Framework for K-12 Science Education" (NRC 2012) computational thinking is linked with mathematics as tools for representing variables and relationships. But what exactly computational thinking means for learning and teaching is not always clear. Does engaging in computational thinking mean students should use spreadsheet software and other computer tools to manage data? Is having students use online simulations to visualize phenomena computational thinking? Should students be writing code and building computational models? Computational thinking can mean all of these things and more. In this article the authors unpack computational thinking practices by presenting a sequence of instructional activities focusing on groundwater contamination. The instructional approach does not require coding but does support students in engaging in the computational thinking necessary to use models to understand problems that are relevant to their lives and communities.},

Particularly, effective assessment of computational thinking can support the understanding of how learners develop computational concepts and practices. Aiming to help advance research on this topic, we propose a data-driven approach to assess computational thinking concepts, based on the automatic analysis of data from learners' computational artifacts. As a proof of concept, the approach was applied to a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to investigate the course's effectiveness as well as to identify points for improvement. The data analyzed consists of over 3300 projects from the course participants, using the Scratch programming language. From that sample, we found patterns in how computational thinking manifests in projects, which can be used as evidence to guide opportunities for improving course design, as well as insights to support further research on the assessment of computational thinking.},

This study investigates the types of tabletop games that are currently being promoted as teaching computational thinking, who such games are marketed towards, and how game designs could provide opportunities for developing computational thinking. We conducted a content analysis to explore the type of tabletop games currently being created, their audiences, and the kinds of game mechanics and design features being implemented to teach computational thinking concepts. In this study, we created a taxonomy of computational thinking tabletop games that identified three primary categories (e.g. code building, code execution, and puzzle games) . Games that fall into our categories share similar learning claims, target audiences, and game mechanics. Our taxonomy offers a starting place for educators who want to explore the use of tabletop games for introducing computational thinking concepts in unplugged settings, suggestions for designers, and areas of investigation for researchers.},

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

To this end, the study was designed to follow a longitudinal research model. Participants were 436 secondary school students. Computational thinking test scores were collected from the students at certain time intervals. Results indicate that computational thinking skills are independent of gender, time, and chronotype but differ significantly depending on grade level. The interaction between grade level and time of testing also has a significant impact on computational thinking skills. The difference in grade level can be interpreted as taking an information technologies course increases computational thinking. The results suggest that such courses should be promoted to children at a young age. The joint effect of gender, grade level, and chronotype were not statistically significant and it is recommended to conduct future studies to investigate this result.},

CP was not observed at the baseline but was evident at the endpoint. Moreover, six of the nine focal students demonstrated a variety of spatial reasoning skills during LEGO{\textregistered} robotics tasks, which are correlated with higher mathematics achievement and academic success. Further analysis revealed that these focal students persisted in problem solving during the LEGO{\textregistered} robotics program.

However, the ways in which computational thinking can be taught more effectively the context of in K-12 programming teaching remain unclear. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of 28 empirical studies on K-12 programming teaching that were published in international education journals in the 21st century to determine which teaching methods and programming tools are most effective in promoting the computational thinking of K-12 students. The results show that (1) programming teaching can promote the improvement of K-12 students' computational thinking (ES = 0.72, z = 9.9, P {$<$} 0.01), with an overall effect at the upper-middle level (95\% CI[0.60,0.83]); (2) scaffolding programming (ES = 1.84, z = 11.9, P {$<$} 0.01) and problem-based programming (ES = 1.14, z = 5.57, P {$<$} 0.01) are the most effective teaching methods and can significantly promote the development of K-12 students' computational thinking (chi[superscript 2] = 40.58, P {$<$} 0.01); (3) since differences in the effect of programming tools between groups are not significant (Chi[superscript 2] = 6.47, P = 0.09), it is impossible to determine which programming tools are most effective; and (4) intervention duration (ES = 0.72, z = 11.9, P {$<$} 0.05, 95\% CI[0.60, 0.83]) and learning scaffold (ES = 0.83, z = 6.27, P {$<$} 0.05, 95\% CI[0.57, 1.09]) are both key moderating variables that affect the improvement of computational thinking.

The sample comprises 202 high school students from German-speaking Switzerland. Concerning the CTt, Rasch-scalability is demonstrated. Utilizing the approach of the PISA studies, proficiency levels are formed that comprise tasks with specific characteristics that students are systematically able to master. This could help teachers to offer individual support to their students. In terms of the CTS, the original version is refined using confirmatory factor and measurement-invariance analysis. A latent profile analysis yielded four profiles, two of which are of particular interest. One profile comprises students with, on the one hand, moderate to high creative thinking ability, cooperativity, and critical thinking skills and, on the other hand, low algorithmic thinking ability. The second remarkable profile consists of students with particularly low cooperativity. Based on these strength and weakness profiles, teachers could offer support tailored to student needs.},

However, most studies on the topic have investigated the development of computational thinking through programming activities, which are cognitively demanding. There is a dearth of evidence on how computational thinking augments everyday problem solving when it is decontextualized from programming. Objectives: In this study, we examined how computational thinking, when untangled from the haze of programming, is demonstrated in everyday problem solving, and investigated the features of such solvable problems. Methods: Using a multiple case study approach, we tracked how seven university students used computational thinking to solve the everyday problem of a route planning task as part of an 8-week-long Python programming course. Results and Conclusions: Computational thinking practices are latent in everyday problems, and intentionally structuring everyday problems is valuable for discovering the applicability of computational thinking. Decomposition and abstraction are prominent computational thinking components used to simplify everyday problem solving. Implications: It is important to strike a balance between the correctness of algorithms and simplification of the process of everyday problem solving.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational thinking has been considered as one of the 21st century skills that all students should have. Researchers emphasize the importance of determining and developing students' computational thinking levels from the earliest possible age. However, no measurement tool has been found in the literature that aims to reveal the computational thinking levels of primary school students. In this study, it was aimed to develop the computational thinking scale for primary school students and to examine the computational thinking levels of primary school students according to different variables (grade level, daily computer use time). In the first stage of the study, a scale with appropriate psychometric properties was developed to measure computational thinking. In the scale development phase of the research, exploratory sequential mixed methods research design was used. In the other phase of the study, it was investigated whether the computational thinking levels of primary school students differed according to the grade level and daily computer usage time without any intervention. For this reason, the research was carried out in accordance with the general survey model, which is one of the descriptive research types. For the first stage, the study group of the research consisted of 287 students studying in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grades of primary schools in Ankara Golbasi district in the second term of the 2021-2022 academic year. In the process of examining the students' computational. thinking levels according to the variables of grade level and daily computer usage time, the study group consisted of a total of 96 students attending the primary education classes of a private school in Ankara in the second term of the 2021-2022 academic year. In this context, the one-dimensional computational thinking scale consisting of 17 items was applied to 287 primary school students and the obtained data were subjected to validity and reliability analysis. According to the explanatory factor analysis, the scale explains 46\% of the total variance. When the results of the explanatory factor analysis are examined, it is seen that the factor loads of 17 items in the scale vary between 56 and 0.86. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was found to be Cronbach Alpha 0.92. The developed scale was applied to primary school students in the next stage. As a result of the study, it was found that the generally computational thinking levels of primary school students differed significantly according to the grade level. On the other hand, it was observed that the students' computational thinking levels differed significantly according to the time spent in front of the computer daily, and the mean of the students' computational thinking scale increased as the daily computer use time increased.},

  abstract = {At present, research on computational thinking in universities is gaining interest, and more attention is being paid to the cultivation and teaching of computational thinking. However, there is a lack of computational thinking assessment tools for college students, which makes it difficult to understand the current status and development of their computational thinking. In this study, computational thinking is regarded as the ability to solve practical problems. By analyzing the relevant literature, we identified five dimensions of computational thinking--decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm and evaluation--and described their operational definitions. Referring to the Bebras and the problem situations in Google computational thinking education, we set up a life-based situation that college students are familiar with. Based on the life story situation, we developed a multidimensional assessment for college students' computational thinking. This assessment tool contains 14 items, all of which are multiple-choice questions, and the structure and quality of the tool are verified by multidimensional item response theory. The results show that the assessment tool has good internal validity and can discriminate different disciplines of college students. The college students' computational thinking test developed in this study can be used as an effective tool to assess college students' computational thinking.},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging and multifaceted competence important to the computing era. However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (M[subscript age] = 14.14 years, SD[subscript age] = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool.},

Computational thinking is a relatively new term in early childhood education that refers to a specific problem-solving thinking process involving various logical and analytical thinking skills. Four foundational skills have been identified as core thinking skills of computational thinking: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithm. We explain these four skills in this paper and their practical applications to teaching and learning in early childhood education. Early computational thinking skills are found in common early childhood activities. This paper identifies activities teachers can use in the classroom to explicitly promote children's computational thinking and provides a new perspective on how to adapt classroom activities to integrate computational thinking. In particular, we emphasize the need to vary the demands of the content in the activity and incorporate computational thinking based on children's needs and development to ensure that children progress through the thinking process.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today's digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today's context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to ``Papert's CT,'' which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that ``Wing's CT'' and ``Papert's CT,'' when correctly understood, are both relevant to today's computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science's centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today's world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically ``transfers'' to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots~of CT.},

Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond. These differences imply that several basic cognitive abilities support CT abilities and CT development differentially across ages.},

  abstract = {The recognized importance of computational thinking has helped to propel the rapid development of related educational efforts and programs over the past decade. Given the multi-faceted nature of computational thinking, which goes beyond programming and computer science, however, approaches and practices for developing students' computational thinking are not always self-explanatory in terms of their foci and feasibility in diverse educational contexts. In this editorial, we first examine relevant publications in computational thinking to identify a trend of integrating computational thinking into disciplinary education. We subsequently build on recent discussions about the concept of computational thinking to (1) frame a review of educational efforts in developing students' computational thinking, (2) discuss opportunities and challenges to further such educational efforts through not only programming and computer science but also other disciplines, and (3) articulate needed research and scholarship to support educational practices.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, children and teenagers use technology products in an increasingly passive way. As simple consumers they cannot benefit from the opportunities of designing technology, which has a learning value. Educational Robotics (ER) programs are particularly effective in delivering contents of difficult disciplines: they can re-establish a balance between the learners and the technological devices, because the learners act as programmers and can develop their computational thinking. Therefore, we believe the school should upgrade its teaching methods, through the implementation of ER programs. This could be done without introducing a new subject, since technology could be considered like an interdisciplinary application module within pre-existing subjects. In this paper, we provide an overview of ER programs to share a practical guidance with those who want to plan educational workshops in their institutes. First, we analyze ER theoretical and epistemological fundamentals: ER has roots in recent and classic disciplines (psychology, cybernetics, robotics, cognitive science{\dots}), but it is also consistent with the principles of widely recognized pedagogies. Then, we describe successful Italian projects with a focus on regulations concerning ER programs. As a result of this analysis, we propose a brief guideline on the following topics: (a) needs analysis, (b) target segmentation, (c) objectives, (d) laboratory setting, (e) contents definition, (f) activities, (g) evaluation tools. Finally, we show that designing learning paths according to this method could also promote a more rigorous (and not only qualitative) evaluation, and then enhance both research and practice in this field.},

The unplugged computing activities involved the tasks with three different difficulty levels covering the CT processes found to be common in CT definitions in the literature. To evaluate students' CT skills, two equivalent tests were constructed from Bebras tasks considering the same parameters (difficulty levels and CT processes). The results showed that students' post-test scores were significantly higher than their pre-test scores. There were not any significant differences between students' scores in terms of gender, and there was no interaction effect between students' CT scores and their gender.},

In their mission to prepare teachers to integrate CT into K-12 schooling, teacher educators would benefit from understanding the different kinds of preconceptions of CT that their students bring to the classroom in order to design learning experiences that build upon that preexisting knowledge. In this systematic literature review of 24 articles, I aim to identify the different types of preconceptions that teachers hold around CT. Results show that teachers hold preconceptions that can affect how they define CT. Specifically, they can conflate CT with (1) technology integration, (2) computer science or programming, (3) other non-specific problem-solving strategies, and (4) "thinking like a computer". They also may hold preconceptions around teaching and learning CT. Specifically, the literature shows they believe CT is a difficult topic to understand that often cannot feasibly be integrated into K-12 education due to curriculum and instruction constraints. In this article, I identify this initial list of preconceptions, demonstrate their presence in the literature, and propose ways for teacher educators to build upon them without antagonizing "incorrect" initial definitions that teachers may hold. Implications and limitations of this work are discussed.},

These definitions often vary significantly, and they have profound implications for curricular and instructional goals within science and STEM classrooms. This theoretical paper summarizes of technology initiatives across science and STEM education from the past 30 years to present perspectives on the role of technology in science-focused STEM education. The most prominent perspectives describe technology as the following: (a) vocational education, industrial arts, or the product of engineering, (b) educational or instructional technology, (c) computing or computational thinking, and (d) the tools and practices used by practitioners of science, mathematics, and engineering. We have identified the fourth perspective as the most salient with respect to K-12 science and STEM education. This particular perspective is in many ways compatible with the other three perspectives, but this depends heavily on the beliefs, prior experiences, and instructional goals of teachers who use technology in their science or STEM classroom.},

We analysed 26 studies carried out in K-12 between 2016 and 2020 in Europe. The results indicate that 18 different tools have been used and they can be categorized into five groups: questionnaires, tests/tasks, observations, interviews and analysis of products. From the tools we analysed, more than 50 dimensions were assessed and the vast majority of those were closer to programming skills rather than CT per se.

Researchers developed some scales for measuring abstraction in BBPEs; however, it is still quite difficult to measure abstraction and understand students' abstraction behaviors. The aim of this study is to suggest tasks that could help enhance students' abstraction skills while teaching CT via block-based programming. In addition, a rubric to score the students' abstraction behaviors in the problem solving process was created and validated. A framework with regard to the definitions of abstraction skill was adopted and the way to isolate it from other CT-skills was proposed. As a result, pattern recognition, generalizing, decomposition, focusing and eliminating were defined as indicators of abstraction in the problem solving process via BBPEs. The study also informed computer science educators about the relations between teaching CT via BBPEs, affordances of BBPEs and nature of abstraction.},

This paper develops systematic methods for detecting, interpreting, and analyzing students' use of strategies in OELEs, and demonstrates how students' strategies evolve across tasks. We apply this framework in the context of tasks that students perform as they learn science topics by building conceptual and computational models in an OELE. Data from a classroom study, where sixth-grade students (N = 52) worked on science model-building activities in our Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM) environment demonstrates how we interpret students' strategy use, and how strategy use relates to their learning performance. We also demonstrate how students' strategies evolve as they work on multiple model-building tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy framework in analyzing students' behaviors and performance in CTSiM.},

Method: We focus on the AT sub-component of CT and present the principled assessment design process using ECD. Findings: Our operationalization of CT includes spatial reasoning as a sub-component. Pilot results showed an acceptable internal consistency reliability for the AT items and critical design decisions that contributed to validity evidence. Implications: An important contribution of this work is the inclusion of spatial reasoning in our definition of early childhood CT.},

Broad definitions provide many avenues for developing integrated instruction, as practices within existing activities can simply be reframed in terms of CT. But such general use of the term CT may confuse its meaning and dilute its power as a tool for bringing CS to all. In this paper, we take the viewpoint that mathematical thinking and computational thinking share common practices, such as using repetition to accomplish tasks, but these shared ideas may develop differently in mathematics and computer science. We use document analysis to analyze the K-5 Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for the presence of these common practices and describe the specific ways they develop in mathematics. We compare these elements of mathematical thinking to related elements of CT to identify synergies and differences between CT and mathematical thinking. We argue that these synergies and differences have implications for the development of integrated instruction designed to bring CS to all.},

Agreeing with this premise, in 2013 the authors of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) included "mathematical and computational thinking" as one of eight essential science and engineering practices that K-12 teachers should strive to develop in their students. There is not yet widespread agreement on the precise definition or implementation of CT, and efforts to assess CT are still maturing, even as more states adopt K-12 computer science standards. In this article we will try to summarize what CT means for a typical introductory (i.e., high school or early college) physics class. This will include a discussion of the ways that instructors may already be incorporating elements of CT in their classes without knowing it.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effect of Including Neurodiversity in Computational Thinking (INFACT), a collection of material for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) in grades 3-8. CT has many definitions, but all borrow concepts from computer science to structure problem-solving processes more generally. The materials are designed for use in inclusion classrooms, where neurodivergent students learn alongside their neurotypical peers. The study examines performance on a measure of CT proficiency for elementary school students who received INFACT instruction over a 10-week period, compared to students who received "business-as-usual" CT instruction. CT performance at baseline was equivalent for both groups, and correlated with performance on a measure of executive function. The INFACT group performed better on the post-intervention CT assessment than their peers in the comparison condition. Post-intervention CT scores for both groups were not correlated with executive function at this time, suggesting that CT instruction in general may help to "even the playing field" for neurodivergent students. Additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which this may occur. A separate validation study for the CT assessment used is appended. [This report was published by Knology.]},

  abstract = {In computer science education at school, computational thinking has been an emerging topic over the last decade. Even though, computational thinking is interpreted and integrated in classrooms in different ways, an identification process about what computational thinking is about has been in progress among computer science school-teachers and computer science education researchers since Wing's initial paper on the characteristics of computational thinking. On the other hand, the constructionist learning theory by Papert, based on constructivism and Piaget, has a long tradition in computer science education for describing the students' learning process by hands-on activities. Our contribution, in this paper, is to present a new mapping tool which can be used to review classroom activities in terms of both computational thinking and constructionist learning. For the tool, we have reused existing definitions of computer science concepts and computational thinking concepts and combined these with our new constructionism matrix. The matrix's most notable feature is its scale of learners' autonomy. This scale represents the degree of choices learners have at each stage of development of their artefact. To develop the scale definitions, we trialed the mapping tool, coding twenty-one popular international computing activities for pupils aged 5 to 11 (K-5). From our trial, we have shown that we can use the mapping tool, with a moderate to high degree of reliability across coders, to analyse classroom activities with regard to computational thinking and constructionism, however, further validation is needed to establish its usefulness. Despite a small number of activities (n = 21) being analysed with our mapping tool, our preliminary results showed several interesting findings. Firstly, that learner autonomy was low for defining the problem and developing their own design. Secondly that the activity type (such as lesson plan rather than online activity) or artefact created (such as physical artefact rather than onscreen activity or unplugged activity), rather than the computational thinking or computer science concept being taught was related to learner autonomy. This provides some tentative evidence, which may seem obvious, that the learning context rather than the learning content is related to degree of constructionism of an activity and that computational thinking per se may not be related to constructionism. However, further work is needed on a larger number of activities to verify and validate this suggestion.},

In addition, much of the research on CT has focused on creating generally agreed-upon definitions and curricula, but few studies have empirically tested assessments or used contemporary learning sciences methods to do so. In this paper, we outline the implementation of an assessment approach for a 10-day high school biology unit with computational thinking activities that examines student pre-post responses as well as responses to embedded assessments throughout the unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group's CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that (1) students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a science unit with computational models and (2) that the use of embedded assessments and discourse analytics tools reveals how students think differently with computational tools throughout the unit.},

However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students' computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students' learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students' computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores.},

However, there is a lack of computational thinking assessment tools for college students, which makes it difficult to understand the current status and development of their computational thinking. In this study, computational thinking is regarded as the ability to solve practical problems. By analyzing the relevant literature, we identified five dimensions of computational thinking--decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm and evaluation--and described their operational definitions. Referring to the Bebras and the problem situations in Google computational thinking education, we set up a life-based situation that college students are familiar with. Based on the life story situation, we developed a multidimensional assessment for college students' computational thinking. This assessment tool contains 14 items, all of which are multiple-choice questions, and the structure and quality of the tool are verified by multidimensional item response theory. The results show that the assessment tool has good internal validity and can discriminate different disciplines of college students. The college students' computational thinking test developed in this study can be used as an effective tool to assess college students' computational thinking.},

We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming.},

A systematic literature review (SLR) consists of a collection of research conducted according to previous criteria with the aim of answering research questions with validity and quality. For this reason, the PRISMA-ScR statement was followed. Articles published in scientific journals, from Scopus and WoS, between January 2018 and August 2021 were included, in the English or Spanish language. The initial search resulted in 492 articles, to which the inclusion-exclusion criteria were applied. The final sample of texts for the present systematic review was n = 145. The texts were analyzed from three perspectives: conceptual, documentary and pedagogical. Thus, a renewal of previous literature reviews was carried out, updating the situation with research from recent years and new data, obtained to contribute to the collective intelligence on methodological strategies (80\% of the sample was divided into "plugged" and "unplugged"); educational (more than 50\% studied CT evaluation); and resources, including a collection of more than 119 educational resources.},

Method: We carefully selected and reviewed 55 empirical studies from leading bibliographic databases and examined the transfer of CT using a meta-analysis and a qualitative synthesis. Results and Conclusions: We identified and summarized these effects in the fields of mathematics, science, engineering and the humanities. A meta-analysis of these studies identified a generally significant effect of the transfer of CT skills to other subject areas. We also explored the characteristics of CT interventions that aid the transfer of learning by qualitatively assessing the identified studies.

This volume introduces a variety of approaches to CT in K-12 education, offering a wide range of international perspectives that focus on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and the integration of computing and physical objects. The book first offers an overview of CT and its importance in K-12 education, covering such topics as the rationale for teaching CT; programming as a general problem-solving skill; and the "phenomenon-based learning" approach. It then addresses the educational implications of the explosion in AI research, discussing, among other things, the importance of teaching children to be conscientious designers and consumers of AI. Finally, the book examines the increasing influence of physical devices in CT education, considering the learning opportunities offered by robotics.},

This study aims to understand how secondary school students' latent profiles are distributed according to computational identity and ARP using a person-centered approach. Afterward, the current research examines how these profiles differ according to CT test performance and CTSE scores. The participants of the study consisted of 601 secondary school students. Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles based on computational identity and resilience: (a) low, (b) low to moderate, (c) moderate to high, (d) high. The effect of profile membership and gender on CTSE and CT test performance was determined by two-way ANOVA analysis. CTSE score increases in profiles where the level of identity and resilience increases. The impact of profiles and gender interaction on CTSE is significant. Low profile male students have significantly lower CTSE scores than other groups. While profiles affected CT performance significantly, no difference is found by gender.},

  abstract = {This study examines the effect of Including Neurodiversity in Computational Thinking (INFACT), a collection of material for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) in grades 3-8. CT has many definitions, but all borrow concepts from computer science to structure problem-solving processes more generally. The materials are designed for use in inclusion classrooms, where neurodivergent students learn alongside their neurotypical peers. The study examines performance on a measure of CT proficiency for elementary school students who received INFACT instruction over a 10-week period, compared to students who received "business-as-usual" CT instruction. CT performance at baseline was equivalent for both groups, and correlated with performance on a measure of executive function. The INFACT group performed better on the post-intervention CT assessment than their peers in the comparison condition. Post-intervention CT scores for both groups were not correlated with executive function at this time, suggesting that CT instruction in general may help to "even the playing field" for neurodivergent students. Additional research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which this may occur. A separate validation study for the CT assessment used is appended. [This report was published by Knology.]},

Um angehende Primarlehrpersonen mit dem erforderlichen Fachwissen und den didaktischen Kompetenzen auszustatten, f{\"u}hrte die PH FHNW im Herbst 2017 das zweiteilige Pflichtmodul <<Informatische Bildung>> f{\"u}r Studierende des Bachelors Primarstufe ein. Zudem fokussierte das Modul darauf, in den Studierenden eine nachhaltige, positive Haltungsver{\"a}nderung hinsichtlich Informatische Bildung auszul{\"o}sen. Die Erstdurchf{\"u}hrung wurde durch mehrfache Datenerhebungen wissenschaftlich begleitet. Eine zentrale Fragestellung war, inwiefern der Besuch des Moduls die Haltungen der Studierenden bez{\"u}glich ihres Selbstkonzepts hinsichtlich Informatische Bildung und der Relevanz von Informatischer Bildung auf der Primarstufe beeinflusste. Dieser Artikel pr{\"a}sentiert kurz das didaktische Konzept des Moduls und beschreibt eine Auswertung der Daten, die bei der ersten Durchf{\"u}hrung der beiden Modulteile erhoben wurden.},

The methodology and findings from twenty studies are summarized and simple economic models are used to elucidate the implicit assumptions made by the authors and to demonstrate the sensitivity of the interpretations of the findings to the relaxation of some of these assumptions.},

Gleichzeitig sind in der disziplin{\"a}ren Erkenntnisgewinnung Denkans{\"a}tze der Universalisierung psychischen Geschehens wie kognitivistisch orientierte Handlungstheorien dominant, die sich an einer naturwissenschaftlich ausgerichteten Psychologie orientieren und ahistorische und asoziale Subjekte kreieren. Die sozialwissenschaftliche Biografieforschung mit ihrer Vergesellschaftsperspektive auf das Konstrukt ,,Biografie`` verfolgt das Ziel, prozessuale, historisierende wie kontextualisierende Fallstudien methodologisch und methodisch zu bearbeiten. Mit dem Zugang der biografischen Fallrekonstruktion werden die subjektiven Erfahrungen und deren erinnernde Zuwendung in Form biografischer Erz{\"a}hlungen in ihrer biografischen Genese und ihren Konstruktionen in der Gegenwart analysiert. Die biografische Fallrekonstruktion nach Rosenthal unterscheidet hier zwischen dem ,,erz{\"a}hlten Leben`` (Gegenwartsperspektive) und dem ,,erlebten Leben`` (Vergangenheitsperspektive). In dem Beitrag werden die Geschichte der ,,biografischen Perspektive`` in der psychologischen Forschung und die Grundannahmen sowie die Auswertungspraxis exemplarisch an einer Fallskizze dargestellt und perspektivische Erweiterungen zu den Analysepositionen Diskurs, Figuration, Situation diskutiert.},

  abstract = {Gerade angesichts der meist kleinen Fallzahlen in der qualitativ-psychologischen Forschung ist eine reflektierte und bewusste Stichprobenziehung bzw. Fallauswahl hier von besonderer Bedeutung. Im Gegensatz zur quantitativen Forschung wird dabei meist keine empirisch-statistische Verallgemeinerung auf ein Kollektiv angestrebt, sondern eine differenzierte Beschreibung weniger F{\"a}lle. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag werden zun{\"a}chst die unterschiedlichen Grundannahmen genauer dargestellt, die der Stichprobenziehung in der quantitativen und in der qualitativen Forschungstradition zugrunde liegen, um so zu einem besseren Verst{\"a}ndnis der Forschungslogik bei der bewussten Stichprobenziehung zu gelangen. Uneinigkeit besteht in der qualitativen Forschung allerdings hinsichtlich der Frage, inwiefern die Stichprobengr{\"o}{\ss}e von Bedeutung ist, wie gro{\ss} die Stichprobe im Rahmen verschiedener qualitativer Forschungsans{\"a}tze jeweils sein sollte und inwieweit eine Vorab-Festlegung einer konkreten Stichprobengr{\"o}{\ss}e sinnvoll ist. Die unterschiedlichen Positionen zu diesen Fragen werden kurz zusammengefasst. Daran schlie{\ss}t sich ein {\"U}berblick zu Strategien der bewussten Fallauswahl an. Einzelne, in der Forschungspraxis besonders relevante Strategien wie die theoretische Stichprobenziehung, der qualitative Stichprobenplan und die Auswahl bestimmter Arten von F{\"a}llen werden weiterhin an Hand von Untersuchungsbeispielen verdeutlicht. Der Beitrag schlie{\ss}t mit {\"U}berlegungen zu M{\"o}glichkeiten der Verallgemeinerung in der qualitativen Forschung unter Nutzung von Alternativkonzepten zur empirisch-statistischen Verallgemeinerung, wie beispielsweise die theoretische Verallgemeinerung oder die {\"U}bertragbarkeit von Ergebnissen.},

Dar{\"u}ber hinaus werden neue methodenangemessene Kriterien formuliert, f{\"u}r die als Beispiel die Glaubw{\"u}rdigkeit qualitativer Forschung diskutiert wird. Vorschl{\"a}ge f{\"u}r Standards nicht standardisierter Forschung sind ein weiterer Ansatz. Die Diversifizierung qualitativer Forschung und die Ausrichtung an Anwendungsfeldern (z.\,B. Gesundheitspsychologie oder Evaluation) werden als Bezugspunkte f{\"u}r die Bewertung qualitativer Forschung behandelt. Abschlie{\ss}end werden neue Vorschl{\"a}ge f{\"u}r Kriterien, eine Systematisierung von vorliegenden Checklisten sowie die Formulierung einer Agenda f{\"u}r die Bewertung qualitativer Forschung vorgestellt.

Entlang der zentralen Stationen werden im 4. Abschnitt typische Herausforderungen des ethnografischen Forschungsprozesses skizziert -- vor allem: Feldzugang, Forschungsrollen, Datenerhebung und -auswertung sowie das Schreiben.

Im Rahmen der deutschsprachigen Psychologie hingegen fand bislang keine Institutionalisierung statt, wobei in den letzten Jahren ein verst{\"a}rktes Interesse an diesen Ans{\"a}tzen zu beobachten ist. Eine Ausnahme bilden Ans{\"a}tze feministischer Psychotherapie, diese sind verh{\"a}ltnism{\"a}{\ss}ig weit verbreitet.

Sie unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich der wissenschaftstheoretischen Grundlagen, Themen und verwendeten Forschungsmethoden. Tendenziell werden h{\"a}ufiger qualitative als quantitative Methoden eingesetzt; manche Forschungsprogramme orientieren sich aber auch prim{\"a}r an den Methoden der quantitativ-experimentellen Psychologie. Hier werden vier verschiedene Felder vorgestellt: 1. die ,,Psychologie der Frau``, 2. die feministische Erforschung von Geschlechtergemeinsamkeiten und -unterschieden, 3. sozialkonstruktionistische, diskursanalytische und dekonstruktivistische Ans{\"a}tze und 4. queere Psychologien.},

  abstract = {This article tackles how to adapt grounded theory by blending it with case study techniques. Grounded theory is commended for enabling qualitative researchers to avoid priori assumptions and intensely explore social phenomena leading to enhanced theorization and deepened contextualized understanding. However, it is criticized for generating enormous data that is difficult to manage, contentious treatment of literature review and category saturation. Further, while the proliferation of several versions of grounded theory brings new insights and some clarity, inevitably some bits of confusion also creep in, given the dearth of standard protocols applying across such versions. Consequently, the combined effect of all these challenges is that grounded theory is predominantly perceived as very daunting, costly and time consuming. This perception is discouraging many qualitative researchers from using grounded theory; yet using it immensely benefits qualitative research. To gradually impart grounded theory skills and to encourage its usage a key solution is to avoid a full-scale grounded theory but instead use its adapted version, which exploits case study techniques. How to do this is the research question for this article. Through a reflective account of my PhD research methodology the article generates new insights by providing an original and novel empirical account about how to adapt grounded theory blending it with case study techniques. Secondly, the article offers a Versatile Interview Cases Research Framework (VICaRF) that equips qualitative researchers with clear research questions and steps they can take to effectively adapt grounded theory by blending it with case study techniques.},

  abstract = {This article provides an overview of the diverse ways in which computational thinking has been operationalised in the literature. Computational thinking has attracted much interest and debatably ranks in importance with the time-honoured literacy skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, learning interventions in this subject have modelled computational thinking differently. We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming.},

This study explores the relationship between computational thinking and learning satisfaction for non-STEM-major college students. A conceptual model is proposed to examine the structural relationships among computational thinking, self-efficacy, self-exploration, enjoyment and learning satisfaction in an AppInventor-based liberal education course. Collecting data from 190 undergraduate students from Taiwan and analyzing the data by using partial least squares (PLS) methods, the research framework confirms the six proposed hypotheses. These results show that both computational thinking and enjoyment play significant roles in both self-exploration and digital self-efficacy. Moreover, digital self-efficacy and self-exploration also have a significant positive influence on learning satisfaction. These findings have implications for influencing the learning outcomes of non-STEM-major college students, computational thinking course instructors, and computational thinking relevant policies.},

In this sense, it is essential to highlight the emergence of new competencies and skills in education due to technological advancements. Legislative frameworks have been developed to incorporate digital literacy, access to robotics, and computational thinking, between others. Hence, this review and meta-analysis aim at identifying the influence of robotics activities on computational thinking through a PRISMA-guided review. The findings reveal that interventions conducted in early childhood education significantly impact computational thinking. Results also showcase that, despite perceived barriers related to technology accessibility, the presence of legislation and contexts prioritizing these competencies is more relevant than the digital access gap.},

The study documented in this article sought to further illuminate answers to this question by focusing on whether the conditions for learning and for students' achievement are better and higher in homogeneous or heterogeneous ability groups. Data from the longitudinal study KESS (Competencies and Attitudes of Students) were used to analyze the relationship between heterogeneity at class level (N = 514) and student achievement (N = 10036). Tracked classes were found to be more homogeneous than classes in comprehensive schools in terms of reading achievement. In relation to mathematics achievement, however, the highest track (Gymnasium) included the most heterogeneous classes. Multilevel analyses showed that achievement heterogeneity in classes had neither positive nor negative effects on individual learning. (DIPF/Orig.)},

  abstract = {This booklet presents a synthesis of the principles of effective teaching that have emerged from research in classrooms. It addresses generic aspects of curriculum, instruction, and assessment as well as classroom organization and management practices that support effective instruction. It focuses on learning outcomes, but recognizes the need for a supportive climate and positive student attitudes toward schooling, teachers, and classmates. Much of the research support for these principles comes from studies of relationships between classroom processes (measured through observation systems) and student outcomes (particularly gains in standardized achievement scores). The booklet contains 12 chapters as follows: (1) "A Supportive Classroom Climate"; (2) "Opportunity to Learn"; (3)"Curricular Alignment"; (4) "Establishing Learning Orientations"; (5) "Coherent Content"; (6) "Thoughtful Discourse"; (7) "Practice and Application Activities"; (8) "Scaffolding Students' Task Engagement"; (9) "Strategy Teaching"; (10) "Cooperative Learning"; (11) "Goal-Oriented Assessment"; and (12) "Achievement Expectations." (Contains 31 references.) (SM)},
